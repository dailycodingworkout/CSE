**Whole Numbers:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... (natural numbers + zero)
**Integers:** ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... (whole numbers + negatives)
**Rational Numbers:** Numbers expressible as p/q where q ≠ 0

- **By 4:** Last two digits divisible by 4
- **By 5:** Last digit 0 or 5
- **By 9:** Sum of digits divisible by 9

#### **HCF and LCM Concepts:**
**Fundamental Relationship:** HCF × LCM = Product of two numbers
**Prime Factorization Method:** Most reliable for finding HCF and LCM
**Division Method:** Efficient for HCF calculation

### Percentage and Its Applications

#### **Percentage Conversion Methods:**
- Convert fractions to percentages: Multiply by 100
- Convert percentages to fractions: Divide by 100
- Convert decimals to percentages: Shift decimal two places right

#### **Percentage Calculation Shortcuts:**
**Common Fraction Equivalents:**
- 12.5% = 1/8
- 25% = 1/4  
- 37.5% = 3/8
- 50% = 1/2
- 62.5% = 5/8
- 75% = 3/4

#### **Percentage Change Concepts:**
**Increase Formula:** ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) × 100
**Decrease Formula:** ((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) × 100

### Ratio and Proportion Fundamentals

#### **Basic Ratio Concepts:**
- Ratio expresses relative sizes
- Ratios can be simplified like fractions
- Cross multiplication for proportion solving

#### **Direct and Inverse Proportion:**
**Direct:** As one increases, other increases proportionally
**Inverse:** As one increases, other decreases proportionally

### Simple Interest Fundamentals

#### **Simple Interest Formula Components:**
- **Principal (P):** Initial amount invested/borrowed
- **Rate (R):** Annual interest rate percentage
- **Time (T):** Duration in years
- **Simple Interest (SI):** Interest earned/paid

#### **Derived Formulas:**
- **Time = (SI × 100) / (P × R)**
- **Rate = (SI × 100) / (P × T)**
- **Principal = (SI × 100) / (R × T)**

### Compound Interest Principles

#### **Compound Interest Concepts:**
- Interest calculated on principal + accumulated interest
- Compounding frequency affects final amount
- Exponential growth pattern

#### **Compound Interest Formulas:**
**Annual Compounding:** A = P(1 + R/100)ᵗ
**Half-yearly Compounding:** A = P(1 + R/200)²ᵗ  
**Quarterly Compounding:** A = P(1 + R/400)⁴ᵗ

#### **CI and SI Relationship:**
- CI > SI for time periods > 1 year
- Difference increases with higher rates and longer periods
- For 2 years: CI - SI = PR²/(100)²

### Profit and Loss Theory

#### **Basic Profit-Loss Concepts:**
**Cost Price (CP):** Price at which item is purchased
**Selling Price (SP):** Price at which item is sold
**Marked Price (MP):** Listed selling price before discount

#### **Profit-Loss Formulas:**
**Profit:** SP > CP, Profit = SP - CP
**Loss:** SP < CP, Loss = CP - SP
**Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100**
**Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100**

#### **Discount Calculations:**
**Single Discount:** Discount% = (MP - SP)/MP × 100
**Successive Discounts:** Combined discount = x + y - (xy/100)

### Time and Work Fundamentals

#### **Work Rate Concepts:**
- Work is measured as one complete unit
- Rate of work = 1/Time taken to complete work
- Combined work rate = Sum of individual rates

#### **Work Efficiency Principles:**
**Individual Capacity:** If A completes work in x days, A's rate = 1/x per day
**Combined Capacity:** A and B together rate = 1/x + 1/y per day
**Time Formula:** Combined time = 1/(1/x + 1/y) = xy/(x+y) days

### Time, Speed and Distance Relationships

#### **Fundamental Formulas:**
- **Distance = Speed × Time**
- **Speed = Distance / Time**  
- **Time = Distance / Speed**

#### **Average Speed Concepts:**
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
(Note: Not arithmetic mean of individual speeds)

#### **Relative Speed Principles:**
**Same Direction:** Relative Speed = |Speed₁ - Speed₂|
**Opposite Direction:** Relative Speed = Speed₁ + Speed₂

#### **Train Problem Concepts:**
**Crossing Objects:** Consider train length + object length
**Time Calculations:** Use relative motion principles
**Speed Conversions:** km/hr to m/s (multiply by 5/18)

### Data Interpretation Fundamentals

#### **Data Reading Strategy:**
1. **Question Analysis:** Understand what data is required
2. **Efficient Scanning:** Locate relevant information quickly
3. **Calculation Optimization:** Use approximation when appropriate
4. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify shortcuts and relationships

**Ratio Comparisons:** Relative quantity analysis
**Growth/Decline Trends:** Period-to-period changes
**Average Calculations:** Central tendency measures

#### **Percentage Change Calculations:**
**Increase Formula:** New Value = Original × (1 + % increase/100)
**Decrease Formula:** New Value = Original × (1 - % decrease/100)
**Percentage of Percentage:** (a% of b%) = (a × b)/100 %

## 🧠 REASONING ABILITY - Logical Foundations

### Syllogism - Logical Reasoning

#### **Statement-Conclusion Relationship:**
- Statements are given facts (assume true)
- Conclusions must logically follow from statements
- No external knowledge should be used

#### **Types of Statements:**
**Universal Positive:** All A are B
**Universal Negative:** No A is B  
**Particular Positive:** Some A are B
**Particular Negative:** Some A are not B

#### **Venn Diagram Method:**
- Visual representation of logical relationships
- Circles represent categories/sets
- Overlaps show common elements
- Most reliable method for complex syllogisms

#### **Conclusion Testing Rules:**
**All/No Statements:** Require definite relationships
**Some Statements:** Require possible relationships
**Validity Check:** Can counter-examples be drawn?

### Inequality Reasoning

#### **Coded Relationship Understanding:**
- Learn the specific symbols used in each question set
- Common patterns: <, ≤, =, ≥, >, ≠
- Maintain consistency in symbol interpretation

#### **Solution Methodology:**
1. **Decode:** Convert symbols to mathematical relationships
2. **Combine:** Form logical chains from given statements  
3. **Analyze:** Test each conclusion against established chains
4. **Verify:** Ensure logical validity of conclusions

### Seating Arrangement Logic

#### **Linear Arrangement Principles:**
- Fixed reference points (left end, right end)
- Relative positioning (immediate left/right, second to left/right)
- Conditional arrangements (if-then relationships)
- Direction consistency (all facing same/opposite directions)

#### **Circular Arrangement Concepts:**
- No fixed end positions - continuous seating
- Direction affects left-right relationships  
- Facing center vs. facing outside orientation
- Use reference person for position mapping

#### **Direction Rules for Circular Arrangements:**
**Facing Center:** Left = Clockwise, Right = Anti-clockwise  
**Facing Outside:** Left = Anti-clockwise, Right = Clockwise

#### **Floor/Building Puzzle Concepts:**
- Vertical arrangement of people/objects
- Ground floor as reference point (usually floor 1)
- Floor gap relationships (x floors above/below)
- Elimination method for remaining positions

### Direction and Distance Reasoning

#### **Cardinal Directions:**
North, South, East, West (primary)
Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest (secondary)

#### **Movement Tracking System:**
- Establish starting reference point
- Track horizontal displacement (East-West axis)
- Track vertical displacement (North-South axis)
- Use coordinate system for complex movements

#### **Distance Calculation Methods:**
**Direct Distance:** Use Pythagorean theorem when applicable
**Manhattan Distance:** Sum of horizontal and vertical distances
**Final Position:** Consider net displacement from origin

### Blood Relations Logic

#### **Relationship Mapping:**
- Generation levels (same, one above, two above)
- Gender identification (male/female)
- Direct vs. indirect relationships

#### **Generation Classification:**
**+1 Generation:** Father, Mother, Uncle, Aunt
**0 Generation:** Brother, Sister, Cousin, Spouse  
**-1 Generation:** Son, Daughter, Nephew, Niece
**-2 Generation:** Grandson, Granddaughter

#### **Gender Identification Rules:**
**Male Relations:** Son, Father, Brother, Uncle, Nephew, Grandfather
**Female Relations:** Daughter, Mother, Sister, Aunt, Niece, Grandmother

#### **Family Tree Method:**
- Visual representation of relationships
- Clear generational hierarchy
- Gender-specific symbols

### Coding-Decoding Patterns

#### **Letter Shifting Patterns:**
- Alphabetical position changes (A=1, B=2, C=3... Z=26)
- Forward/backward movement in alphabet
- Fixed increment patterns

#### **Common Coding Patterns:**
1. **Uniform Shift:** Each letter moves by same count
2. **Reverse Order:** Complete word reversal  
3. **Position Exchange:** Systematic letter swapping
4. **Conditional Rules:** Different rules for vowels/consonants

#### **Pattern Recognition Strategy:**
- Compare original and coded words
- Identify transformation rules
- Apply same logic to test words
- Verify pattern consistency
