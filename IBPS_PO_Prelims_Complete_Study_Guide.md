- Continue until all factors are prime
- Result: Same prime factorization

**Applications of Prime Factorization:**

**Finding Number of Factors:**
- If n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × pₖ^aₖ
- Number of factors = (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(aₖ + 1)
- **Example:** 60 = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹ → Factors = (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3×2×2 = 12

**Finding Sum of Factors:**
- Sum = [(p₁^(a₁+1) - 1)/(p₁ - 1)] × [(p₂^(a₂+1) - 1)/(p₂ - 1)] × ...
- **Example:** For 60 = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹
- Sum = [(2³-1)/(2-1)] × [(3²-1)/(3-1)] × [(5²-1)/(5-1)]
- Sum = [7/1] × [8/2] × [24/4] = 7 × 4 × 6 = 168

#### **LCM & HCF - MASTERY TECHNIQUES**

- **Formula:** Percentage = (Part/Whole) × 100

**Fraction to Percentage Conversion:**
- **Method:** Multiply fraction by 100
- **Examples:**
  * 1/4 = (1/4) × 100 = 25%
  * 3/5 = (3/5) × 100 = 60%
  * 7/8 = (7/8) × 100 = 87.5%

**Percentage to Fraction Conversion:**
- **Method:** Write percentage over 100 and simplify
- **Examples:**
  * 25% = 25/100 = 1/4
  * 60% = 60/100 = 3/5
  * 87.5% = 87.5/100 = 7/8

**Essential Percentage-Fraction Equivalents (Memorize These):**
- 10% = 1/10, 12.5% = 1/8, 16⅔% = 1/6, 20% = 1/5
- 25% = 1/4, 33⅓% = 1/3, 37.5% = 3/8, 40% = 2/5
- 50% = 1/2, 60% = 3/5, 62.5% = 5/8, 66⅔% = 2/3
- 75% = 3/4, 80% = 4/5, 83⅓% = 5/6, 87.5% = 7/8

#### **PERCENTAGE CHANGE CALCULATIONS**

**Percentage Increase:**
- **Formula:** % Increase = [(New Value - Original Value)/Original Value] × 100
- **Example:** Price increases from ₹100 to ₹120
  * % Increase = [(120-100)/100] × 100 = 20%

**Percentage Decrease:**
- **Formula:** % Decrease = [(Original Value - New Value)/Original Value] × 100
- **Example:** Price decreases from ₹150 to ₹120
  * % Decrease = [(150-120)/150] × 100 = 20%

**Reverse Percentage Calculations:**
- **If value increased by x%:** Original = Final/(1 + x/100)
- **If value decreased by x%:** Original = Final/(1 - x/100)
- **Example:** After 25% increase, value is ₹150. Find original.
  * Original = 150/(1 + 25/100) = 150/1.25 = ₹120

#### **SUCCESSIVE PERCENTAGE CHANGES**

**Two Successive Changes:**
- **Formula:** Net % change = a + b + (ab/100)
- Where a and b are the two percentage changes
- **Example:** 20% increase followed by 10% decrease
  * Net change = 20 + (-10) + (20×(-10)/100) = 20 - 10 - 2 = 8% increase

**Multiple Successive Changes:**
- **Method:** Apply changes one by one
- **Example:** 100 → +10% → 110 → +20% → 132 → -15% → 112.2
- **Overall change:** (112.2 - 100)/100 = 12.2% increase

#### **PARTNERSHIP - COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK**

**Basic Partnership Concepts:**
- **Partners:** People who invest money in business
- **Capital:** Money invested by each partner
- **Profit/Loss:** Shared in ratio of their investments

**Simple Partnership:**
- **Time period same for all partners**
- **Profit ratio = Investment ratio**
- **Example:** A invests ₹30,000, B invests ₹20,000
  * Profit ratio = 30,000:20,000 = 3:2

**Compound Partnership:**
- **Time periods different for partners**
- **Profit ratio = (Investment × Time) ratio**
- **Example:** 
  * A invests ₹30,000 for 12 months
  * B invests ₹20,000 for 6 months

### 🎯 TIME & WORK - MASTERY SYSTEM

#### **FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS**

**Basic Definitions:**
- **Work:** Complete task or job (assumed as 1 unit)
- **Rate of Work:** Portion of work done per unit time
- **Time:** Duration taken to complete work

**Basic Formula:**
- **Work = Rate × Time**
- **Rate = Work/Time**
- **Time = Work/Rate**

**Key Principle:**
- **If person completes work in n days, rate = 1/n per day**
- **Example:** A completes work in 10 days → A's rate = 1/10 per day

#### **SINGLE PERSON WORK PROBLEMS**

**Basic Calculations:**
- **Work done in given time:** (1/n) × t = t/n
- **Time for partial work:** If work = w, then time = w × n
- **Remaining work:** 1 - (work done)

**Example Problem:**
A can complete a work in 15 days. How much work will he complete in 6 days?
- **Solution:** A's rate = 1/15 per day
- Work in 6 days = (1/15) × 6 = 6/15 = 2/5

#### **MULTIPLE PERSONS WORK PROBLEMS**

**Combined Work Rate:**
- **If A completes in 'a' days and B in 'b' days**
- **Combined rate = 1/a + 1/b**
- **Combined time = 1/(1/a + 1/b) = ab/(a+b)**

**Example Problem:**
A can complete work in 12 days, B in 15 days. In how many days can they complete together?
- **Solution:** 
  * A's rate = 1/12, B's rate = 1/15
  * Combined rate = 1/12 + 1/15 = (5+4)/60 = 9/60 = 3/20
  * Time together = 1/(3/20) = 20/3 = 6⅔ days

**Three or More Persons:**
- **Combined rate = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c + ...**
- **Example:** A:10 days, B:15 days, C:20 days
  * Combined rate = 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/20 = (6+4+3)/60 = 13/60
  * Time = 60/13 = 4⁸⁄₁₃ days

#### **WORK & WAGES PROBLEMS**

**Basic Principle:**
- **Wages are distributed in ratio of work done**
- **Work done ∝ Efficiency ∝ Rate**

**Example Problem:**
A, B, C can complete work in 10, 15, 20 days respectively. If they work together and earn ₹1300, find individual shares.
- **Solution:**
  * Rates: A = 1/10, B = 1/15, C = 1/20
  * Ratio of rates = 1/10 : 1/15 : 1/20 = 6:4:3 (LCM method)
  * A's share = (6/13) × 1300 = ₹600
  * B's share = (4/13) × 1300 = ₹400  
  * C's share = (3/13) × 1300 = ₹300

  * Time = 100/10 = 10 seconds

**Train Crossing a Moving Object:**
- **Same Direction:** Time = (L₁ + L₂)/(S₁ - S₂)
- **Opposite Direction:** Time = (L₁ + L₂)/(S₁ + S₂)
- **Where:** L₁, L₂ = lengths, S₁, S₂ = speeds

**Train Crossing a Bridge/Platform:**
- **Time = (Length of Train + Length of Bridge)/Speed**
- **Example:** 150m train crossing 250m bridge at 72 km/hr

  * Time = (150 + 250)/20 = 20 seconds

#### **BOAT & STREAM PROBLEMS**

**Fundamental Concepts:**
- **Downstream:** Boat + Stream (speeds add)
- **Upstream:** Boat - Stream (stream opposes)

**Key Formulas:**
- **Downstream Speed = Boat Speed + Stream Speed**
- **Upstream Speed = Boat Speed - Stream Speed**
- **Boat Speed = (Downstream + Upstream)/2**
- **Stream Speed = (Downstream - Upstream)/2**

**Example Problem:**
Boat travels 20 km downstream in 2 hours and 12 km upstream in 3 hours. Find boat and stream speeds.
- **Solution:**
  * Downstream speed = 20/2 = 10 km/hr
  * Upstream speed = 12/3 = 4 km/hr
  * Boat speed = (10 + 4)/2 = 7 km/hr
  * Stream speed = (10 - 4)/2 = 3 km/hr
