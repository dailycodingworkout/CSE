## 🔢 QUANTITATIVE APTITUDE - Master with Shortcuts

### Simplification & Number System

#### **BODMAS Mastery - Solve in 30 Seconds:**

**Super Shortcut for Complex Calculations:**
```
Example: 25% of 240 + 30% of 180 - 15% of 200
Quick Method:
25% of 240 = 240/4 = 60
30% of 180 = 180 × 3/10 = 54  
15% of 200 = 200 × 15/100 = 30
Answer: 60 + 54 - 30 = 84
```

#### **Percentage Shortcuts - Lightning Fast:**

**Method 1: For 12.5%, 25%, 37.5% etc.**
- 12.5% = 1/8, so 12.5% of 800 = 800/8 = 100
- 25% = 1/4, so 25% of 600 = 600/4 = 150  
- 37.5% = 3/8, so 37.5% of 800 = 800 × 3/8 = 300

**Method 2: Base 50 technique**
- 18% of 250 = 18 × 250/100 = 18 × 2.5 = 45
- **Trick:** When second number ends in 50, multiply first by 2.5

### Arithmetic - High-Scoring Topics

#### **Simple & Compound Interest - 100% Accuracy:**

**SI Formula Shortcuts:**
```
Time = (SI × 100)/(P × R)
Rate = (SI × 100)/(P × T)  
Principal = (SI × 100)/(R × T)
```

**CI Super Shortcuts:**
```
For 2 years: CI = SI + (SI)²/(100)
For 3 years: CI = SI + 3(SI)²/100 + (SI)³/(100)²
```

**Solved Example:**
A sum becomes ₹1200 in 2 years and ₹1320 in 3 years at SI. Find principal?
**Solution:** 
- Interest for 1 year = 1320 - 1200 = ₹120
- Interest for 2 years = 120 × 2 = ₹240  
- Principal = 1200 - 240 = ₹960

#### **Profit & Loss - Score Full Marks:**

**Golden Formulas:**
```
If SP = 120% of CP, then Profit = 20%
If SP = 80% of CP, then Loss = 20%
MP = CP × (100 + Profit%)/(100 - Discount%)
```

**Shortcuts for Successive Discounts:**
- Two discounts of 10% and 20% = Single discount of 28%
- **Formula:** x + y - xy/100

**Solved Example:**
Marked price is ₹500. After 20% and 10% discount, SP = ?
**Solution:**
- Single discount = 20 + 10 - (20×10)/100 = 30 - 2 = 28%
- SP = 500 × (100-28)/100 = 500 × 0.72 = ₹360

#### **Time & Work - Master the Logic:**

**Work Rate Concept:**
```
If A can do work in 10 days, A's rate = 1/10 per day
If B can do work in 15 days, B's rate = 1/15 per day
Together rate = 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6 per day
Time together = 6 days
```

**Shortcut Formula:**
```
A and B together = (A × B)/(A + B) days
```

**Solved Example:**
A can complete work in 12 days, B in 18 days. How long together?
**Solution:** (12 × 18)/(12 + 18) = 216/30 = 7.2 days

#### **Time, Speed & Distance - Never Miss a Question:**

**Basic Formulas:**
```
Speed = Distance/Time
Average Speed = Total Distance/Total Time
Relative Speed = Speed₁ + Speed₂ (opposite direction)
Relative Speed = Speed₁ - Speed₂ (same direction)
```

**Train Problems Shortcuts:**
```
Time to cross pole = Length of train/Speed of train
Time to cross platform = (Length of train + platform)/Speed
```

**Solved Example:**
A 100m train crosses a 150m platform in 10 seconds. Find speed?
**Solution:** 
- Total distance = 100 + 150 = 250m
- Speed = 250/10 = 25 m/s = 25 × 18/5 = 90 km/hr

### Data Interpretation - Score Maximum

#### **Table DI Strategy:**
1. **Read question first** - Know what data you need
2. **Scan for exact numbers** - Don't calculate unless needed  
3. **Use approximation** - For ratio/percentage questions
4. **Look for shortcuts** - Same base numbers, round figures

#### **Percentage Increase/Decrease Shortcuts:**
```
% Increase = (New - Old)/Old × 100
% Decrease = (Old - New)/Old × 100
```

**Quick Calculation Tricks:**
- If something increases by 25%, multiply by 1.25
- If something decreases by 20%, multiply by 0.8
- For finding % of %, multiply percentages and divide by 100

## 🧠 REASONING ABILITY - Master Every Type

### Syllogism - Score 100% (4-5 Questions)

#### **Venn Diagram Method - Never Fail:**

**Rule 1: Universal Statements**
- "All A are B" = Complete circle A inside circle B
- "No A are B" = Separate circles with no overlap
- "Some A are B" = Overlapping circles

**Rule 2: Conclusion Testing**
- All/No conclusions need definite relationship
- Some conclusions need possible relationship
- **Trick:** If you can draw counter-example, conclusion is false

**Solved Examples:**
```
Statements: All books are pages. Some pages are words.
Conclusions: 
I. All books are words
II. Some words are books

Solution:
I. FALSE - No direct relationship between books and words
II. POSSIBLE - Some area where pages overlap with words might contain books
Answer: Only II follows
```

#### **Coded Inequalities - 100% Accuracy (3-4 Questions)**

**Standard Code Pattern:**
```
A @ B means A > B
A # B means A < B  
A $ B means A ≥ B
A % B means A ≤ B
A & B means A = B
```

**Solution Method:**
1. **Decode** all statements
2. **Combine** to form chain
3. **Check** each conclusion against the chain

**Example:**
```
P @ Q, Q # R, R $ S
Decoded: P > Q, Q < R, R ≥ S
Chain: P > Q < R ≥ S
Conclusion: P > S = FALSE (no direct comparison possible)
```

### Puzzles & Seating Arrangement - Master Strategy

#### **Linear Arrangement - Step-by-Step Method:**

**Step 1: Draw the Layout**
```
For 7 people in a row facing North:
Position: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7
Person:   _  _  _  _  _  _  _
Direction: All facing North
```

**Step 2: Find Fixed Points**
- Look for definite positions (end positions, middle)
- Person sitting exactly at position X

**Step 3: Use Relative Information**  
- A sits 2nd to the right of B
- C sits between D and E

**Step 4: Fill Remaining Positions**

**Pro Tip:** Always start with most restrictive condition

#### **Circular Arrangement - Special Techniques:**

**Key Differences from Linear:**
- No end positions - everyone has 2 neighbors
- Facing center vs facing outside changes left/right
- Use one person as reference point

**Direction Rules:**
```
Facing Center: Left = Clockwise, Right = Anti-clockwise  
Facing Outside: Left = Anti-clockwise, Right = Clockwise
```

**Solved Example:**
8 people sit in circle facing center. A sits 3rd right of B.
**Solution:** If B is at position 1, A is at position 1+3 = 4

#### **Floor Puzzles - Master Formula:**

**Standard Pattern:** Different people on different floors
**Approach:**
1. **Fix reference point** (usually ground floor = 1)
2. **Use floor gap information** (2 floors above, 1 floor below)
3. **Apply elimination** for remaining positions

### Direction Sense - Never Make Mistake (2-3 Questions)

#### **Movement Tracking System:**

**Step 1: Set Starting Point**
```
      N
      ↑
W ←─────→ E  
      ↓
      S
```

**Step 2: Track Each Movement**
- Forward = same direction
- Left turn = anti-clockwise (-90°)
- Right turn = clockwise (+90°)
- About turn = opposite direction (180°)

**Example Problem:**
```
Starting: North direction
Walks 5km → North 5km from start
Turns right → Now facing East  
Walks 3km → East 3km from previous position
Turns left → Now facing North
Walks 2km → North 2km from previous position

Final Position: 3km East, 7km North from start
Distance from start = √(3² + 7²) = √58 ≈ 7.6 km
```

### Blood Relations - Formula Based (2-3 Questions)

#### **Relationship Codes:**
```
+1 Generation: Father, Mother, Uncle, Aunt
0 Generation: Brother, Sister, Cousin, Spouse  
-1 Generation: Son, Daughter, Nephew, Niece
-2 Generation: Grandson, Granddaughter
```

#### **Gender Determination Rules:**
- Son/Father/Brother/Uncle/Nephew/Grandfather = Male
- Daughter/Mother/Sister/Aunt/Niece/Grandmother = Female

**Solved Example:**
```
"A is B's father's sister's daughter"
Step by step:
B's father = +1 generation male
Father's sister = +1 generation female (Aunt)  
Sister's daughter = 0 generation female
So A is B's cousin (female)
```

### Coding-Decoding - Pattern Recognition (2-3 Questions)

#### **Letter Position Method:**
```
A=1, B=2, C=3... Z=26
Example: CAB = 3,1,2
Pattern: +2 each = 5,3,4 = ECB
```

#### **Common Patterns:**
1. **+/- same number:** Each letter moves by same count
2. **Reverse order:** ABCD becomes DCBA  
3. **Position swap:** 1st↔2nd, 3rd↔4th
4. **Vowel/Consonant:** Different rules for vowels and consonants
