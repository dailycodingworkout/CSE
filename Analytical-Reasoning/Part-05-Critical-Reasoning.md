# Part 5: Critical Reasoning

## The Singularity

**The Atomic Truth:** *Arguments are claims supported by evidence.*

## 5.1 Understanding Critical Reasoning

### What is Critical Reasoning?

Critical Reasoning involves:
1. **Identifying** the structure of arguments
2. **Evaluating** the strength of reasoning
3. **Finding** assumptions, conclusions, and evidence
4. **Assessing** what strengthens or weakens an argument

### The Anatomy of an Argument

### Key Terminology

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Premise** | Evidence or facts supporting the conclusion | "All students who studied passed the exam." |
| **Conclusion** | The main claim being made | "Therefore, John passed the exam." |
| **Assumption** | Unstated premise needed for argument to work | "John studied." |
| **Inference** | What can be logically derived | "Studying leads to passing." |

## 5.2 Identifying Argument Components

### Finding the Conclusion

**Conclusion Indicators:**
- Therefore
- Thus
- Hence
- So
- Consequently
- As a result
- It follows that
- This shows that
- We can conclude that

**Position:** Often at the end, but can be anywhere.

### Finding the Premises

**Premise Indicators:**
- Because
- Since
- As
- Given that
- For
- The reason is
- Due to
- This is evident from

### Finding Assumptions

**The Bridge Test:**
1. Identify the gap between premises and conclusion
2. What must be true for the conclusion to follow?
3. That unstated belief is the assumption

**Example:**
```
Premise: All successful companies have strong leadership.
Premise: TechCorp has strong leadership.
Conclusion: TechCorp will be successful.

Hidden Assumption: Strong leadership is sufficient for success
                   (not just necessary).
```

## 5.3 Types of Critical Reasoning Questions

### 5.3.1 Assumption Questions

**Question Stems:**
- "Which of the following is an assumption?"
- "The argument depends on which of the following?"
- "The argument assumes that..."

**Strategy:**
1. Identify conclusion and premises
2. Find the gap in logic
3. Choose the option that bridges the gap

### 5.3.2 Strengthen Questions

**Question Stems:**
- "Which of the following strengthens the argument?"
- "Which would provide additional support?"
- "Which makes the conclusion more likely?"

**Strategy:**
1. Understand the argument's logic
2. Look for options that:
   - Add supporting evidence
   - Eliminate alternative explanations
   - Confirm assumptions

### 5.3.3 Weaken Questions

**Question Stems:**
- "Which of the following weakens the argument?"
- "Which undermines the conclusion?"
- "Which casts doubt on the argument?"

**Strategy:**
1. Understand the argument's logic
2. Look for options that:
   - Provide counter-evidence
   - Suggest alternative explanations
   - Attack the assumptions

### 5.3.4 Inference/Conclusion Questions

**Question Stems:**
- "Which can be inferred from the passage?"
- "Which must be true based on the information?"
- "Which conclusion is best supported?"

**Strategy:**
1. Read all given information carefully
2. Eliminate options that:
   - Go beyond the information
   - Contradict the information
   - Make unsupported claims
3. Choose the most directly supported option

### 5.3.5 Paradox/Resolve Questions

**Question Stems:**
- "Which explains the discrepancy?"
- "Which resolves the paradox?"
- "Which accounts for the apparent contradiction?"

**Strategy:**
1. Identify the two seemingly contradictory facts
2. Find an option that explains how both can be true

## 5.4 Common Argument Patterns

### 5.4.1 Causal Arguments

**Pattern:** X causes Y

**Structure:**
```
Observation: When X happens, Y happens.
Conclusion: X causes Y.
```

**Weakening Methods:**
1. Show Y happens without X (X not necessary)
2. Show X happens without Y (X not sufficient)
3. Suggest a third factor Z causes both
4. Show reverse causation (Y causes X)

**Example:**
```
Argument: Countries with high chocolate consumption have more 
          Nobel laureates. Therefore, eating chocolate improves 
          intelligence.

Weakening: Wealthy countries can afford both chocolate and 
           education (third factor).
```

### 5.4.2 Statistical Arguments

**Pattern:** Sample implies population

**Structure:**
```
Data: X% of sample has property P.
Conclusion: X% of population has property P.
```

**Weakening Methods:**
1. Sample is not representative
2. Sample size is too small
3. Selection bias exists
4. Data collection was flawed

### 5.4.3 Analogy Arguments

**Pattern:** A is like B in some ways, so A is like B in other ways

**Structure:**
```
Premise: A and B share properties X, Y, Z.
Conclusion: A also has property W (like B does).
```

**Weakening Methods:**
1. Show relevant differences between A and B
2. Show W is not related to X, Y, Z
3. Find a counterexample

### 5.4.4 Expert Opinion Arguments

**Pattern:** Expert says X, so X is true

**Weakening Methods:**
1. Expert lacks relevant credentials
2. Expert has bias or conflict of interest
3. Expert opinion is disputed by other experts
4. Expert is speaking outside their field

## 5.5 Logical Fallacies

### 5.5.1 Formal Fallacies

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Affirming the Consequent** | If P→Q and Q, conclude P | If it rains, ground is wet. Ground is wet. ∴ It rained. |
| **Denying the Antecedent** | If P→Q and ¬P, conclude ¬Q | If it rains, I take umbrella. No rain. ∴ No umbrella. |
| **Undistributed Middle** | Syllogism with middle term never distributed | All A are B. All C are B. ∴ All A are C. |

### 5.5.2 Informal Fallacies

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Ad Hominem** | Attack the person, not the argument | "You can't trust his data; he failed math." |
| **Straw Man** | Misrepresent opponent's argument | "You want to reduce defense spending? You want us defenseless!" |
| **False Dichotomy** | Present only two options when more exist | "You're either with us or against us." |
| **Slippery Slope** | Small step leads inevitably to extreme | "If we allow X, soon we'll have Y and Z!" |
| **Appeal to Authority** | Irrelevant expert support | "This diet works because a celebrity uses it." |
| **Circular Reasoning** | Conclusion restates premise | "The Bible is true because it says so in the Bible." |
| **Hasty Generalization** | Conclude from too few examples | "I met two rude people from X. Everyone from X is rude." |
| **Post Hoc** | After this, therefore because of this | "I wore lucky socks and won. The socks caused the win." |
| **Appeal to Emotion** | Use emotions instead of logic | "Think of the children!" |
| **Bandwagon** | Everyone does it, so it's right | "Millions use this product, so it must be good." |

## 5.6 The Negation Test for Assumptions

### How It Works

To verify if X is an assumption:
1. Negate X (assume X is false)
2. Check if the argument still holds
3. If argument falls apart, X IS an assumption
4. If argument still works, X is NOT an assumption

### Example

```
Argument: "Our company's sales increased after we launched 
           the advertising campaign. Therefore, the campaign 
           was effective."

Potential Assumption: Sales increase was due to the advertising 
                      campaign (not other factors).

Negation: Sales increase was NOT due to the advertising campaign.

Test: If sales increase was due to something else (economy, 
      competitor failure), then we CANNOT conclude the campaign 
      was effective.

Conclusion: The assumption is valid.
```

## 5.7 GATE-Specific Patterns

### Pattern 1: Statement-Assumption

**Format:**
```
Statement: [Claim]
Assumptions:
I. [Assumption 1]
II. [Assumption 2]

Options:
(A) Only I
(B) Only II
(C) Both I and II
(D) Neither I nor II
```

**Strategy:**
Apply negation test to each assumption independently.

### Pattern 2: Statement-Conclusion

**Format:**
```
Statement: [Evidence]
Conclusions:
I. [Conclusion 1]
II. [Conclusion 2]

Options:
(A) Only I follows
(B) Only II follows
(C) Both follow
(D) Neither follows
```

**Strategy:**
Check if each conclusion is:
- Definitely true based on statement
- Possibly true (not enough for "follows")
- Could be false

### Pattern 3: Cause-Effect

**Format:**
```
[Description of phenomenon with implied causation]

Question: Which of the following best explains...?
```

**Strategy:**
Look for the option that provides a mechanism or eliminates alternatives.

## 5.8 Worked Examples

### Example 1: Finding Assumptions

**Passage:**
"The government should invest more in renewable energy. Countries that have invested heavily in solar and wind power have seen significant economic growth in the energy sector."

**Question:** Which is an assumption made in the argument?

**Options:**
(A) Economic growth in the energy sector is desirable.
(B) All countries can afford to invest in renewable energy.
(C) Solar and wind are the only forms of renewable energy.
(D) Investment in renewable energy causes economic growth.

**Analysis:**
```
Premise: Countries with renewable investment → economic growth
Conclusion: Government should invest more

For the conclusion to follow:
- Must assume economic growth is good (A) ✓
- Must assume investment causes growth, not just correlation (D) ✓

Check each:
(A) If growth weren't desirable, why invest? Must be assumed. ✓
(B) Not necessary; argument is about "should," not "can." ✗
(C) Not necessary; other forms don't affect the argument. ✗
(D) Crucial; correlation vs causation gap. ✓

Best answer: (D) - directly bridges the logical gap
```

**Answer:** (D)

### Example 2: Weakening

**Passage:**
"Studies show that students who eat breakfast perform better on exams. Therefore, schools should provide free breakfast to improve academic performance."

**Question:** Which most weakens the argument?

**Options:**
(A) Some students don't like the food provided in school cafeterias.
(B) Students who eat breakfast also tend to have more educated parents.
(C) Providing breakfast is expensive for schools.
(D) Many high-performing students skip breakfast.

**Analysis:**
```
Argument: Breakfast → Better performance → Schools should provide

To weaken: Attack the causal link

(A) Irrelevant to causation; just implementation issue. ✗
(B) Suggests third variable (educated parents) causes both 
    breakfast AND performance. Weakens causation! ✓
(C) Cost concern, doesn't weaken the logic. ✗
(D) Counter-evidence to correlation. ✓

(B) is stronger because it provides alternative explanation.
(D) provides counter-example but could be exception.
```

**Answer:** (B)

### Example 3: Strengthening

**Passage:**
"Company X's new employee wellness program has led to a 15% reduction in sick days. The program includes gym memberships and healthy food options."

**Question:** Which most strengthens the conclusion that the program caused the reduction?

**Options:**
(A) Employees report higher job satisfaction.
(B) The reduction occurred immediately after the program started.
(C) Other companies with similar programs saw no reduction.
(D) There were no other changes in company policies during this period.

**Analysis:**
```
To strengthen causation: Eliminate alternatives

(A) Correlation with satisfaction, not causation. ✗
(B) Temporal proximity suggests causation, but not definitive. Weak ✓
(C) Actually WEAKENS (shows program doesn't work elsewhere). ✗
(D) Eliminates confounding variables. Strong ✓
```

**Answer:** (D)

### Example 4: Paradox Resolution

**Passage:**
"City A implemented strict traffic rules and increased fines. Despite this, the number of traffic violations increased by 20% in the following year."

**Question:** Which best explains this paradox?

**Options:**
(A) The police department hired more traffic officers.
(B) Citizens protested against the new rules.
(C) Similar cities saw increases in violations too.
(D) The new rules were poorly communicated to drivers.

**Analysis:**
```
Paradox: Stricter rules + higher fines → MORE violations (unexpected)

To resolve: Explain how both can be true

(A) More officers = more detection, not more actual violations! 
    The NUMBER of caught violations increased. ✓
(B) Protests don't explain increased violations. ✗
(C) Doesn't explain THIS city's paradox. ✗
(D) Poor communication could lead to more violations, 
    but doesn't fully explain. Partial ✓

(A) perfectly resolves: detection increased, not actual violations.
```

**Answer:** (A)

## 5.9 Speed Techniques

### Technique 1: The Core Question

Before reading options, ask:
- "What is the author trying to prove?"
- "What evidence is provided?"
- "What's the gap in logic?"

### Technique 2: Predict Before Reading Options

1. Understand the argument
2. Predict what a good answer looks like
3. Match prediction with options
4. Avoid trap answers

### Technique 3: Elimination by Extreme

Eliminate options that:
- Are too strong ("always," "never," "all")
- Are too weak (don't affect the argument)
- Are irrelevant to the argument's logic

### Technique 4: The Scope Test

A correct answer must:
- Be within the scope of the argument
- Not introduce entirely new topics
- Address the specific logical relationship

## 5.10 Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Assumption

**Passage:**
"The city council should approve the new metro line. Studies show that cities with metro systems have lower traffic congestion and better air quality."

**Which assumption is most necessary?**
(A) The new metro line will be used by commuters.
(B) Traffic congestion is the main cause of poor air quality.
(C) Other cities' experiences apply to this city.
(D) The metro line will be completed on time.

**Solution:**
```
The argument generalizes from other cities to THIS city.
For this to work, the experiences must be transferable.

(A) Important but secondary.
(B) Not stated or needed.
(C) Critical bridge between evidence and conclusion. ✓
(D) Implementation issue, not logical assumption.
```

**Answer:** (C)

### Problem 2: Strengthen

**Passage:**
"Remote work has become popular since the pandemic. Companies report that employee productivity has remained stable or increased. Therefore, companies should continue allowing remote work."

**Which strengthens this argument?**
(A) Employees prefer working from home.
(B) Remote work reduces office maintenance costs.
(C) Productivity is the main metric for business success.
(D) Some employees work longer hours at home.

**Solution:**
```
Argument: Productivity stable/up → Should continue remote work

(A) Preference is a bonus but not productivity-related. Weak ✓
(B) Adds another benefit (cost), strengthens overall case. ✓
(C) Makes productivity THE key factor, strengthening the link. ✓✓
(D) Suggests exploitation, could weaken. ✗

(B) or (C) are strong; (C) directly validates the reasoning.
```

**Answer:** (C) [or (B) depending on context]

### Problem 3: Weaken

**Passage:**
"Countries that banned plastic bags saw a significant reduction in plastic pollution. Therefore, our country should ban plastic bags to reduce pollution."

**Which weakens this argument?**
(A) Plastic bags are a small portion of total plastic pollution.
(B) Alternative bags are more expensive.
(C) Some countries have not banned plastic bags.
(D) Plastic bag manufacturing employs many workers.

**Solution:**
```
Argument: Ban plastic bags → Reduce pollution

(A) Even if bags are banned, pollution won't reduce much 
    if bags are a tiny portion. Directly weakens! ✓
(B) Economic concern, not logical weakness. ✗
(C) Irrelevant; doesn't affect the argument. ✗
(D) Economic concern, not about pollution. ✗
```

**Answer:** (A)

### When to Use Mapping

- Complex arguments with multiple layers
- When you need to identify which part is attacked
- For distinguish between main and intermediate conclusions

## 5.12 Key Takeaways

### The 5-Second Snap-Check

Before finalizing:
1. ✓ Did I identify the conclusion correctly?
2. ✓ Does my answer address the logical relationship?
3. ✓ Is my answer within scope?
4. ✓ Did I check for extreme language traps?

### Memory Anchors

**For Assumptions:**
> "The silent bridge between what's said and what's concluded."

**For Strengthen:**
> "Add evidence or eliminate alternatives."

**For Weaken:**
> "Attack the bridge, not the endpoints."

**For Inference:**
> "What MUST be true, not what MIGHT be true."

### The Mental Slider

**Imagine an argument as a bridge:**
- Premises are pillars on one side
- Conclusion is on the other side
- Assumption is the bridge deck

**Weaken:** Remove a plank from the bridge
**Strengthen:** Add support beams
**Assumption:** Find the hidden structural element
