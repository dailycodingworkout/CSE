## 2. Grammar Fundamentals

### 2.1 Parts of Speech — The 8 Building Blocks

#### The Mental Model: Think of a Sentence as a Movie

| Part of Speech | Movie Analogy | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Noun** | The Actor | *The **scientist** discovered a cure.* |
| **Pronoun** | The Stunt Double | ***She** discovered a cure.* |
| **Verb** | The Action Scene | *The scientist **discovered** a cure.* |
| **Adjective** | The Costume | *The **brilliant** scientist discovered a cure.* |
| **Adverb** | The Director's Cut | *The scientist **quickly** discovered a cure.* |
| **Preposition** | The Set Location | *The scientist worked **in** the lab.* |
| **Conjunction** | The Scene Connector | *She worked hard **and** succeeded.* |
| **Interjection** | The Dramatic Pause | ***Wow!** She succeeded.* |

#### Quick Identification Tricks

| Part | Trick | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Noun | Can you put "the" before it? | the book, the happiness |
| Verb | Does it show action or state? | run, is, become |
| Adjective | Does it answer "what kind?" | red car, tall building |
| Adverb | Does it end in "-ly"? (mostly) | quickly, slowly |

**Edge Case Alert:**
- "Fast" can be both adjective (a fast car) and adverb (he runs fast)
- "Well" is an adverb (she sings well), not "good" (WRONG: she sings good)

### 2.2 Tenses — The Time Machine of Language

#### The 12-Tense Matrix

| | Past | Present | Future |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| **Simple** | He **wrote** | He **writes** | He **will write** |
| **Continuous** | He **was writing** | He **is writing** | He **will be writing** |
| **Perfect** | He **had written** | He **has written** | He **will have written** |
| **Perfect Continuous** | He **had been writing** | He **has been writing** | He **will have been writing** |

#### The Golden Rule of Tense Consistency

> **"A sentence is a timeline. Don't time-travel randomly."**

**Wrong:** *He went to the market and buys vegetables.*  
**Right:** *He went to the market and bought vegetables.*

#### Exam Traps — The Examiner's Favorites

1. **Present Perfect vs Simple Past**
   - *I have seen him yesterday.* ❌ (Yesterday = specific past)
   - *I saw him yesterday.* ✅
   - *I have seen that movie.* ✅ (No specific time)

2. **Since vs For**
   - *Since* = Point in time (since 2020, since Monday)
   - *For* = Duration (for 5 years, for 3 hours)
   - *He has been working here since five years.* ❌
   - *He has been working here for five years.* ✅

3. **Time Clauses with Future**
   - *When he will come, I will tell him.* ❌
   - *When he comes, I will tell him.* ✅
   - **Rule:** After when/before/after/until/as soon as → Use Simple Present for future

#### The 5-Second Snap Check

| Signal Word | Tense Required |
|-------------|----------------|
| yesterday, ago, last week | Simple Past |
| already, yet, ever, never | Present Perfect |
| since, for (with duration) | Perfect Continuous |
| tomorrow, next, will | Future |
| now, at this moment | Present Continuous |

### 2.3 Articles (A, An, The) — The Tiny Giants

#### The Atomic Truth

> **"A/An = One of many. The = The specific one."**

#### The Decision Tree

```
Is it SPECIFIC (known to listener)?
├── YES → Use "THE"
│   Example: "The book you lent me was great."
│
└── NO → Is it COUNTABLE & SINGULAR?
    ├── YES → Use "A" or "AN"
    │   ├── Vowel SOUND → AN (an hour, an MBA)
    │   └── Consonant SOUND → A (a university, a one-day trip)
    │
    └── NO → Use NO ARTICLE or "SOME"
        Example: "Water is essential." (general)
        Example: "The water in this bottle is cold." (specific)
```

#### The Sound Rule (Not Spelling!)

| Word | Article | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| hour | an hour | Silent 'h', vowel sound /aʊ/ |
| university | a university | Starts with /juː/ (consonant sound) |
| MBA | an MBA | Pronounced /em/, vowel sound |
| one | a one-time offer | Starts with /wʌn/ (consonant sound) |
| honest | an honest man | Silent 'h' |
| European | a European | Starts with /juː/ |

#### Zero Article Cases (No Article Needed)

1. **General plurals:** *Dogs are loyal.* (not "The dogs")
2. **Abstract nouns (general):** *Honesty is the best policy.*
3. **Meals:** *Let's have lunch.* (but: *The lunch was delicious.*)
4. **Languages:** *She speaks French.*
5. **Games/Sports:** *He plays cricket.*
6. **Days/Months:** *I'll see you on Monday.*

#### Fixed Expressions to Memorize

| With "THE" | Without Article |
|------------|-----------------|
| the radio, the internet | by bus/car/train |
| the same, the only | at home, at work |
| the first, the last | in bed, in hospital (British) |
| the rich, the poor | go to school/college |
| the United States | play tennis/chess |

### 2.4 Prepositions — The Relationship Managers

#### The Mental Slider: Visualize Position

```
                    ABOVE/OVER
                         ↑
    BEHIND ← ← ←    [OBJECT]    → → → IN FRONT OF
                         ↓
                    BELOW/UNDER

    IN (inside)     ON (surface)     AT (point)
```

#### Time Prepositions: The IN-ON-AT Pyramid

```
         AT (specific time)
         ├── at 5 PM
         ├── at noon
         └── at midnight

      ON (days & dates)
      ├── on Monday
      ├── on 15th August
      └── on my birthday

   IN (longer periods)
   ├── in January
   ├── in 2024
   ├── in the morning
   └── in summer
```

**Exception Alert:** "at night" (not "in the night")

#### The Tricky Preposition Pairs

| Preposition | Usage | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Between** | Two items | Between you and me |
| **Among** | More than two | Among all the students |
| **Beside** | Next to | Sit beside me |
| **Besides** | In addition to | Besides English, she knows French |
| **Into** | Movement inside | He jumped into the pool |
| **In** | Already inside | He is in the pool |

#### Verb + Preposition (Fixed Combinations)

| Combination | Meaning | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| agree with (person) | share opinion | I agree with you |
| agree to (proposal) | accept | I agree to your terms |
| consist of | be made of | Water consists of H₂O |
| depend on | rely | Success depends on effort |
| differ from | be unlike | This differs from that |
| dispose of | get rid of | Dispose of waste properly |
| insist on | demand | He insisted on paying |
| object to | oppose | I object to this decision |
| prevent from | stop | Rain prevented us from going |
| succeed in | achieve | She succeeded in passing |

### 2.5 Subject-Verb Agreement — The Marriage Contract

#### The Atomic Truth

> **"The verb must agree with the SUBJECT, not the nearest noun."**

#### The Core Rules

**Rule 1: Singular Subject = Singular Verb**
- *The boy runs.* ✅
- *The boys run.* ✅

**Rule 2: Beware of Interrupters**
- *The quality of the apples is good.* ✅ (Subject = quality)
- *The quality of the apples are good.* ❌

**Rule 3: Compound Subjects**
| Connector | Verb Agreement |
|-----------|----------------|
| and | Plural verb: *Ram and Shyam are friends.* |
| or/nor | Agree with NEARER subject: *Neither the teacher nor the students were present.* |
| along with, together with, as well as | Agree with FIRST subject: *The PM, along with ministers, is attending.* |

**Rule 4: Indefinite Pronouns**
| Always Singular | Always Plural | Context-Dependent |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| each, every, either, neither | both, few, many, several | all, some, none, most |
| everyone, someone, anybody | | (depends on noun referred to) |

- *Everyone has arrived.* ✅
- *Few have understood.* ✅
- *Some of the water is dirty.* ✅ (water = uncountable)
- *Some of the students are absent.* ✅ (students = plural)

**Rule 5: Collective Nouns**
- **As unit:** *The team is playing well.* (British often use plural)
- **As individuals:** *The jury are divided in their opinions.*

**Rule 6: Titles, Names, and Words as Words**
- *"The Lord of the Rings" is a great book.* ✅
- *"Economics" is my favorite subject.* ✅
- *Twenty dollars is not enough.* ✅ (amount as unit)

#### The Examiner's Trap Sentences

| Sentence | Correct? | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| One of the students are absent. | ❌ | Subject = "One" (singular) |
| One of the students is absent. | ✅ | |
| A lot of time has been wasted. | ✅ | time = uncountable |
| A lot of people have gathered. | ✅ | people = plural |
| The news are shocking. | ❌ | news = singular |
| The news is shocking. | ✅ | |

## 3. Sentence Structure & Correction

| *I only ate one apple.* | *I ate only one apple.* | "Only" modifies "one apple" |
| *Walking down the street, the building caught my eye.* | *Walking down the street, I noticed the building.* | The building wasn't walking! |

#### Error Type 2: Dangling Modifiers

**Wrong:** *After reading the letter, tears came to her eyes.*  
**Right:** *After reading the letter, she had tears in her eyes.*  
**Why:** "Tears" didn't read the letter.

#### Error Type 3: Parallel Structure

**The Rule:** Items in a list must have the same grammatical form.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| *She likes swimming, to read, and cooking.* | *She likes swimming, reading, and cooking.* |
| *He is smart, hardworking, and has honesty.* | *He is smart, hardworking, and honest.* |

#### Error Type 4: Run-on Sentences and Comma Splices

**Run-on:** *I love reading I go to the library every day.*  
**Comma Splice:** *I love reading, I go to the library every day.*

**Fixes:**
1. Period: *I love reading. I go to the library every day.*

| Category | Words | Function |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Addition** | Moreover, furthermore, also, besides | Add information |
| **Contrast** | However, but, yet, nevertheless, although | Show opposition |
| **Cause-Effect** | Therefore, hence, thus, consequently | Show result |
| **Example** | For instance, such as, for example | Illustrate |
| **Conclusion** | Finally, in conclusion, to sum up | End argument |
| **Sequence** | First, then, next, subsequently | Show order |

#### The Pronoun Trail

> **"Every pronoun must have an antecedent."**

If a sentence starts with "He," "She," "It," "This," or "These," look for the previous sentence that introduces the noun.

**Example:**
- A: Einstein was born in Germany.
- B: He developed the theory of relativity.
- C: This theory revolutionized physics.

Order: A → B → C (Pronoun chain: Einstein → He → This theory)
