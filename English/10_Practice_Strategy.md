# Time Management Mastery

└── Beyond 60 seconds: Mark and move on
```

## Time Traps to Avoid

| Trap | Problem | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Perfectionism** | Spending 3+ minutes on one question | Set mental timer, move on |
| **Second-guessing** | Changing answers repeatedly | Trust first instinct unless certain |
| **Reading too carefully** | Reading every word slowly | Strategic skimming for RC |
| **Blank paralysis** | Getting stuck on tough blanks | Skip, return later |
| **Order obsession** | Solving in given order | Attack easy questions first |

# Error Minimization Techniques

## Pre-Answer Checklist

Before selecting any answer, quickly verify:

```
☐ Did I read the COMPLETE question?
☐ Did I check what's being ASKED?
☐ Did I eliminate OBVIOUSLY wrong options?
☐ Does my answer FIT grammatically?
☐ Does my answer make LOGICAL sense?
☐ Am I SURE, or is this a guess?
```

## Common Mistake Patterns

### Mistake 1: Misreading "NOT" or "EXCEPT"

```
Question: "Which of the following is NOT correct?"
Mistake: Selecting a correct option

PREVENTION: Circle negative words in the question
```

### Mistake 2: Partially Correct Answers

```
Question asks for "best" answer
Mistake: Selecting first option that seems right

PREVENTION: Read ALL options before selecting
```

### Mistake 3: Overthinking

```
Simple question with obvious answer
Mistake: Looking for hidden complexity

PREVENTION: If it looks simple, it probably is simple
```

### Mistake 4: Vocabulary Overconfidence

```
You "know" a word but are actually wrong
Mistake: Selecting without verification

PREVENTION: Use context clues to verify meaning
```

What was once considered a rare privilege has become a mainstream practice, accelerated by global events that forced organizations to adapt quickly. Studies indicate that remote work offers numerous benefits, including increased productivity, better work-life balance, and reduced commuting stress.

However, the shift is not without challenges. Employees often report feelings of isolation, difficulty in separating work from personal life, and challenges in collaboration. Managers, too, face obstacles in maintaining team cohesion and monitoring performance without resorting to intrusive surveillance.

Despite these challenges, most experts believe that a hybrid model—combining remote and in-office work—represents the future of work. This approach aims to capture the benefits of flexibility while preserving the collaborative advantages of physical presence.
