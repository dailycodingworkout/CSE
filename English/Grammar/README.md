## 1. Parts of Speech

### The 8 Building Blocks of English

| Part of Speech | Function | Question it Answers | Example |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Noun** | Names things | What/Who? | *The **engineer** solved it.* |
| **Pronoun** | Replaces noun | Who/What (without naming)? | ***She** solved it.* |
| **Verb** | Shows action/state | What happened? | *She **solved** it.* |
| **Adjective** | Describes noun | What kind/Which/How many? | *The **brilliant** engineer* |
| **Adverb** | Modifies verb/adj/adv | How/When/Where/To what extent? | *She solved it **quickly**.* |
| **Preposition** | Shows relationship | Where/When (position)? | *The book is **on** the table.* |
| **Conjunction** | Connects words/clauses | How are they related? | *Smart **and** hardworking* |
| **Interjection** | Expresses emotion | What feeling? | ***Wow!** That's amazing.* |

### 🧠 The Mental Slider: Word Function Test

**The same word can be different parts of speech based on function:**

```
"The LIGHT is bright."     → LIGHT is a NOUN (thing)
"Please LIGHT the candle." → LIGHT is a VERB (action)
"This is a LIGHT bag."     → LIGHT is an ADJECTIVE (describes bag)
```

### 💡 The Golden Rule
> **Position determines function.** Before a noun? Likely adjective. After "is/am/are"? Could be anything. Always check WHAT it's doing.

### ⚠️ Exam Trap Alert

**Question Pattern:** "Identify the part of speech of the underlined word."

**The Trap:** Words like "fast," "hard," "early," "late" can be BOTH adjective AND adverb WITHOUT changing form.

```
"She runs FAST." → Adverb (modifies verb "runs")
"She is a FAST runner." → Adjective (modifies noun "runner")
```

## 2. Tenses

### The Time Machine: 12 Tenses Explained

#### 🔑 The Master Framework

```
TENSE = TIME (Past/Present/Future) + ASPECT (Simple/Continuous/Perfect/Perfect Continuous)
```

| **Past** | V2 | was/were + V4 | had + V3 | had been + V4 |
| **Future** | will + V1 | will be + V4 | will have + V3 | will have been + V4 |

**Where:**
- V1 = Base form (go)

## 3. Subject-Verb Agreement

### The Atomic Truth: **Singular Subject = Singular Verb; Plural Subject = Plural Verb**

### The Core Rules

#### Rule 1: Identify the TRUE Subject

**Trap:** Words between subject and verb don't change agreement.

```
"The list OF ITEMS is long." 
→ "list" is singular → "is" (ignore "items")

"The students IN THE CLASS are intelligent."
→ "students" is plural → "are"
```

**Key Phrases to Ignore:**
- along with
- together with  
- as well as
- including
- besides
- in addition to
- accompanied by

```
"The CEO, along with his advisors, IS attending." (CEO = singular)
"The professor, as well as the students, WAS present." 
```

#### Rule 2: Either...Or / Neither...Nor

**The Proximity Rule:** Verb agrees with the CLOSER subject.

```
"Either the teacher OR the students ARE responsible."
"Neither the students NOR the teacher IS responsible."
```

#### Rule 3: Collective Nouns

| Situation | Number | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Acting as ONE unit | Singular | "The team IS winning." |
| Acting as INDIVIDUALS | Plural | "The team ARE arguing among themselves." |

**Common Collective Nouns:** team, jury, committee, family, audience, staff, public, government

#### Rule 4: Indefinite Pronouns

| Always Singular | Always Plural | Depends on Context |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| each, every, everyone | both, few, many | all, some, most |
| everybody, anyone | several, others | none, any, more |
| somebody, nobody | | half, part |
| nothing, either, neither | | percentage, fraction |

```
"Everyone HAS submitted." (Singular)
"Both HAVE submitted." (Plural)
"Some of the water IS spilled." (Water = uncountable = singular)
"Some of the books ARE missing." (Books = countable = plural)
```

#### Rule 5: Subjects Joined by "AND"

**Generally Plural:**
```
"The manager and the assistant ARE here."
```

**Exception - Same entity or idea:**
```
"Bread and butter IS my breakfast." (One item)
"The director and producer IS John." (Same person)
"Slow and steady WINS the race." (One concept)
```

#### Rule 6: Titles, Names, Numbers

**Always Singular (treated as one unit):**
```
"The Times of India IS a famous newspaper."
"Two thousand rupees IS a lot of money."
"Fifty kilometers IS a long distance."
```

#### Rule 7: "The number of" vs. "A number of"

```
"THE number of students IS increasing." (Singular - refers to the number)
"A number of students ARE absent." (Plural - means "many")
```

#### Rule 8: Here/There + Be

**Verb agrees with the subject that FOLLOWS:**
```
"Here IS the book." (book = singular)
"There ARE many options." (options = plural)
```

### 🎯 The 5-Second SVA Check

1. Find the main verb
2. Ask "Who/What [verb]?" → That's your subject
3. Strip away prepositional phrases
4. Check: Subject singular? → Verb singular. Subject plural? → Verb plural.
5. Double-check exceptions (collective nouns, compound subjects)

### 🔥 Killer Exam Questions

**Type 1: Hidden Subject**
```
"Climbing mountains (is/are) dangerous."
→ Climbing (gerund as subject) = singular → IS
```

**Type 2: Inverted Sentences**
```
"On the table (was/were) the documents."
→ Documents = plural → WERE
```

**Type 3: Relative Clauses**
```
"She is one of those people who (believe/believes)."
→ "who" refers to "people" (plural) → BELIEVE

"She is the only one of those people who (believe/believes)."
→ "who" refers to "one" (singular) → BELIEVES
```

## 4. Articles

### The Atomic Truth: **Articles signal specificity and countability**

### The Three Articles

| Article | Type | Use |
|---------|------|-----|
| **A** | Indefinite | Before consonant SOUNDS, singular countable nouns |
| **AN** | Indefinite | Before vowel SOUNDS, singular countable nouns |
| **THE** | Definite | Specific/known item, unique items |

### 🔑 A vs. AN: The Sound Rule

**It's about SOUND, not spelling!**

```
A + Consonant SOUND:
✅ a university (yu- sound)
✅ a European (yu- sound)  
✅ a one-rupee coin (wu- sound)
✅ a useful book (yu- sound)

AN + Vowel SOUND:
✅ an hour (silent h → vowel sound)
✅ an honest person
✅ an MBA degree (em- sound)
✅ an X-ray (eks- sound)
```

### When to Use THE (Definite Article)

#### Use THE:

1. **Unique things:**
   - the sun, the moon, the earth, the sky, the equator

2. **Superlatives:**
   - the best, the first, the most intelligent

3. **Ordinals:**
   - the first, the second, the last

4. **Musical instruments:**
   - play the guitar, the piano (when speaking generally)

5. **Specific bodies of water, mountain ranges, groups:**
   - the Ganges, the Himalayas, the United States, the European Union

6. **Newspapers, holy books (sometimes):**
   - the Times, the Quran, the Bible

7. **When both speaker and listener know what is referred:**
   - "Did you lock the door?" (the specific door we both know)

8. **With adjectives used as nouns (for groups):**
   - the rich, the poor, the elderly, the unemployed

### When NOT to Use THE (Zero Article)

1. **Languages and academic subjects:**
   ```
   ❌ "She studies the Physics."
   ✅ "She studies Physics."
   ```

2. **Meals, games, sports:**
   ```
   ❌ "Let's have the dinner."
   ✅ "Let's have dinner."
   ```

3. **Proper nouns (names of people, most countries, cities):**
   ```
   ✅ India, Delhi, Mount Everest, Lake Baikal
   BUT: the United States, the Netherlands, the Philippines
   ```

4. **Uncountable and plural nouns used generally:**
   ```
   ✅ "Water is essential." (water in general)
   ✅ "Dogs are loyal." (dogs in general)
   ```

5. **Means of transport after "by":**
   ```
   ✅ "by bus, by train, by air"
   BUT: "in the bus, on the train" (when inside)
   ```

### 🎯 The Article Decision Tree

```
Is it a noun?
├── NO → No article needed (usually)
└── YES → Is it countable?
          ├── NO (uncountable) → THE if specific, ZERO if general
          └── YES → Is it singular?
                    ├── NO (plural) → THE if specific, ZERO if general
                    └── YES → Is it specific/known?
                              ├── YES → THE
                              └── NO → A/AN
```

### 🔥 Tricky Exam Cases

**Case 1: Abstract Nouns**
```
❌ "The honesty is the best policy."
✅ "Honesty is the best policy."
(Abstract nouns used generally = no article)

BUT: "The honesty he showed was remarkable." (Specific honesty)
```

**Case 2: Hospital, School, Church, Prison, Bed**
```
"He is in hospital." (As a patient - British)
"He is in the hospital." (The building - American)

"She goes to school." (As a student)
"She went to the school." (The building)
```

**Case 3: Diseases**
```
No article: cancer, diabetes, malaria, cholera
With "the": the flu, the measles (optional)
```

| **DURING** | Throughout period | during the lecture, during winter |
| **WITHIN** | Inside time limit | within 3 days (before the end of) |

**💡 Memory Trick:**
```
AT → A specific Time (AT = A Time)

"Distribute AMONG the students."

Exception: BETWEEN for distinct items even if >2
"There are differences BETWEEN the three theories."
```

**SINCE vs. FOR**
```
SINCE = Point in time → Since Monday, since 2020
FOR = Duration → For 5 hours, for 3 years

## 6. Voice (Active/Passive)

### The Atomic Truth: **Active = Doer acts; Passive = Receiver is acted upon**

### Basic Transformation

```
ACTIVE:  Subject (Doer) + Verb + Object (Receiver)
PASSIVE: Subject (Receiver) + Be + V3 + by + Object (Doer)
```

### Voice Conversion Table

| Tense | Active | Passive |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Simple Present | writes | is written |
| Present Continuous | is writing | is being written |
| Present Perfect | has written | has been written |
| Simple Past | wrote | was written |
| Past Continuous | was writing | was being written |
| Past Perfect | had written | had been written |
| Simple Future | will write | will be written |
| Future Perfect | will have written | will have been written |

### Step-by-Step Conversion

**Active → Passive:**
1. Object becomes Subject
2. Subject becomes Object (with "by")
3. Add appropriate form of "be"
4. Change verb to V3 (past participle)

**Example:**
```
Active: "The team COMPLETED the project."
        Subject   Verb        Object

Passive: "The project WAS COMPLETED by the team."
         Subject      Be + V3      by + Object
```

### Special Cases

**Case 1: Sentences with Two Objects**
```
Active: "She gave ME a book."
         S    V   IO   DO

Passive (using IO): "I was given a book by her."
Passive (using DO): "A book was given to me by her."
```

**Case 2: Questions in Passive**
```
Active: "Did the company launch the product?"
Passive: "Was the product launched by the company?"
```

**Case 3: Modals**
```
Active: "They CAN solve this problem."
Passive: "This problem CAN BE SOLVED by them."

Structure: Modal + be + V3
```

**Case 4: Imperatives**
```
Active: "Open the door."
Passive: "Let the door be opened."
         OR "You are requested to open the door."
```

**Case 5: Infinitives**
```
Active: "I want someone to help me."
Passive: "I want to be helped."
```

### When to Use Passive Voice

1. **Doer is unknown:** "My wallet WAS STOLEN."
2. **Doer is unimportant:** "The bridge WAS BUILT in 1990."
3. **Scientific writing:** "The sample WAS HEATED to 100°C."
4. **Formal writing:** "Applications ARE INVITED for..."
5. **Focus on action:** "The match WAS WON by India."

### 🎯 Quick Identification

**Passive Voice Markers:**
- is/am/are/was/were/been/being + V3
- by + agent (optional)

**Check:** Can you add "by someone"? If yes, it's passive.

### 🔥 Exam Traps

**Trap 1: "By" doesn't always indicate passive**
```
"He sat BY the window." (Preposition of place, not passive)
"The book BY John is famous." (Author, not passive)
```

**Trap 2: Intransitive verbs cannot be passivized**
```
❌ "He was slept." (Sleep is intransitive)
❌ "She was laughed." (Laugh is intransitive)
But: "She was laughed AT." (Phrasal verb with object)
```

**Trap 3: Some verbs never passive**
- Resemble: ❌ "She is resembled by her mother."
- Lack: ❌ "Sense is lacked by him."
- Have (possession): ❌ "A car is had by me."

## 7. Narration (Direct/Indirect Speech)

### The Atomic Truth: **Narration is perspective shift + tense shift**

### Basic Structure

```
DIRECT:   He said, "I am happy."
                    ↓
INDIRECT: He said that he was happy.
```

### The Three Shifts

#### 1. Pronoun Shift (SON Rule)

| Direct | Indirect (follows...) |
|--------|----------------------|
| First Person (I, we, me, us) | **S**ubject of reporting verb |
| Second Person (you) | **O**bject of reporting verb |
| Third Person (he, she, they) | **N**o change |

```
Direct: He said to me, "I will help you."
        S              I=He    you=me
Indirect: He told me that he would help me.
```

#### 2. Tense Shift (Backshift)

| Direct Speech | Indirect Speech |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Simple Present → | Simple Past |
| Present Continuous → | Past Continuous |
| Present Perfect → | Past Perfect |
| Simple Past → | Past Perfect |
| Past Continuous → | Past Perfect Continuous |
| Will → | Would |
| Can → | Could |
| May → | Might |
| Must → | Had to (or remains "must") |

**Exception - No Tense Change When:**
- Universal truths: "The teacher said that the sun RISES in the east."
- Habitual actions still true: "He said he GOES to gym daily."
- Reporting verb in present tense: "He says that he IS happy."
- Hypothetical conditions: "She said if she WERE rich..."

#### 3. Time/Place Word Shift

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| now → | then |
| today → | that day |
| tonight → | that night |
| yesterday → | the previous day / the day before |
| tomorrow → | the next day / the following day |
| last week → | the previous week |
| next week → | the following week |
| ago → | before |
| here → | there |
| this → | that |
| these → | those |
| come → | go |
| bring → | take |

## 8. Modals

### The Atomic Truth: **Modals express possibility, ability, permission, or obligation**

### The Modal Family

| Modal | Primary Meaning | Example |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **CAN** | Ability, Informal permission | "I CAN swim." |
| **COULD** | Past ability, Polite request | "COULD you help?" |
| **MAY** | Possibility, Formal permission | "It MAY rain." |
| **MIGHT** | Lower possibility | "He MIGHT come." |
| **WILL** | Future, Determination | "I WILL do it." |
| **WOULD** | Conditional, Polite request | "WOULD you like tea?" |
| **SHALL** | Future (formal), Suggestion | "SHALL we go?" |
| **SHOULD** | Advice, Probability | "You SHOULD study." |
| **MUST** | Strong obligation, Certainty | "You MUST attend." |
| **OUGHT TO** | Moral obligation | "You OUGHT TO help." |
| **NEED** | Necessity | "You NEED NOT worry." |
| **DARE** | Courage | "How DARE you!" |
| **USED TO** | Past habit | "I USED TO play." |

### Modal Properties

1. **No -s for third person:** He CAN (not: He cans)
2. **Followed by base verb:** She MUST go (not: She must goes/going)
3. **No "to" after modals:** I CAN swim (not: I can to swim)
   - Exception: OUGHT TO, USED TO, HAVE TO
4. **No modal + modal:** ❌ "She will can come"
   - Use: "She will be able to come"

### Expressing the Same Meaning

| Meaning | Present/Future | Past |
|---------|---------------|------|
| Ability | can, am able to | could, was able to |
| Permission | may, can | was/were allowed to |
| Possibility | may, might, could | may/might/could have + V3 |
| Obligation | must, have to | had to |
| Advice | should, ought to | should have + V3 |
| Certainty | must, will | must have + V3 |

### Perfect Modals (Past Reference)

| Structure | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| must have + V3 | Certainty about past | "He MUST HAVE LEFT." |
| should have + V3 | Unfulfilled obligation | "You SHOULD HAVE TOLD me." |
| could have + V3 | Missed possibility | "I COULD HAVE HELPED." |
| might have + V3 | Past possibility | "They MIGHT HAVE WON." |
| would have + V3 | Conditional past | "I WOULD HAVE COME." |
| needn't have + V3 | Unnecessary action done | "You NEEDN'T HAVE WAITED." |

### 🎯 Must vs. Have to vs. Should

| Modal | Strength | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|
| MUST | Strongest | Internal/speaker's authority |
| HAVE TO | Strong | External obligation |
| SHOULD | Advice | Recommendation |

```
"You MUST submit today." (I'm telling you)
"You HAVE TO submit today." (Rules say so)
"You SHOULD submit today." (It's a good idea)
```

**Negative forms:**
```
"You MUSTN'T smoke." (Prohibited)
"You DON'T HAVE TO attend." (No obligation - optional)
"You SHOULDN'T smoke." (Not advised)
```

### 🔥 Exam Traps

**Trap 1: "Must" in past**
```
❌ "Yesterday I must go." 
✅ "Yesterday I HAD TO go."
```

**Trap 2: "Used to" vs. "Would"**
```
USED TO → Past states AND habits
"I USED TO live in Delhi." (State)
"I USED TO/WOULD play cricket." (Habit)

WOULD → Only past habits (not states)
❌ "I would live in Delhi." 
```

**Trap 3: Need not + V1 vs. Need not have + V3**
```
"You NEED NOT wait." (Don't wait - unnecessary)
"You NEEDN'T HAVE WAITED." (You waited, but it was unnecessary)
```

## 9. Conditionals

### The Atomic Truth: **Conditionals = IF (condition) → THEN (result)**

### The Four Types

#### Type 0: Universal Truth/Facts
```
Structure: If + Present Simple, Present Simple
Usage: General truths, scientific facts

"If you heat water to 100°C, it boils."
"If it rains, the ground gets wet."
```

#### Type 1: Real/Likely Condition (Future)
```
Structure: If + Present Simple, will + V1
Usage: Real possibilities, likely situations

"If you study hard, you WILL pass."
"If it rains tomorrow, I WILL stay home."
```

#### Type 2: Unreal/Hypothetical (Present)
```
Structure: If + Past Simple, would + V1
Usage: Imaginary present, unlikely situations

"If I WERE rich, I WOULD travel the world."
"If she STUDIED harder, she WOULD score better."

Note: "WERE" is used for all persons (If I were, If he were)
```

#### Type 3: Unreal Past (Impossible Now)
```
Structure: If + Past Perfect, would have + V3
Usage: Imaginary past, regrets, impossible changes

"If I HAD STUDIED, I WOULD HAVE PASSED."
"If she HAD LEFT earlier, she WOULD HAVE CAUGHT the train."
```

### Mixed Conditionals

**Past Condition → Present Result:**
```
"If I HAD STUDIED medicine, I WOULD BE a doctor now."
(Type 3 condition, Type 2 result)
```

**Present Condition → Past Result:**
```
"If she WEREN'T so lazy, she WOULD HAVE FINISHED by now."
(Type 2 condition, Type 3 result)
```

### Alternative Conditional Words

| Instead of "IF" | Usage | Example |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| Unless | If...not | "UNLESS you hurry, you'll be late." |
| Provided/Providing | On condition that | "I'll come PROVIDED you invite me." |
| As long as | Only if | "AS LONG AS you promise, I'll help." |
| In case | For a possible situation | "Take an umbrella IN CASE it rains." |
| Suppose/Supposing | What if | "SUPPOSE you failed, what then?" |
| But for | If not for | "BUT FOR your help, I'd have failed." |

### Inversion in Conditionals

**Formal/Written English - Drop "if" and invert:**

| Type | With If | Inverted |
|------|---------|----------|
| Type 1 | If he should come... | SHOULD he come... |
| Type 2 | If I were you... | WERE I you... |
| Type 3 | If I had known... | HAD I known... |

```
"HAD I known, I would have helped." (= If I had known)
"WERE she here, she would agree." (= If she were here)
"SHOULD you need help, call me." (= If you should need)
```

### 🎯 Quick Reference Table

| Type | Condition | Result | Time |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| 0 | Present Simple | Present Simple | Always |
| 1 | Present Simple | will + V1 | Future (Real) |
| 2 | Past Simple | would + V1 | Present (Unreal) |
| 3 | Past Perfect | would have + V3 | Past (Unreal) |

### 🔥 Exam Traps

**Trap 1: Time in the "if" clause**
```
❌ "If it will rain, I will stay home."
✅ "If it RAINS, I will stay home."
(Present simple in "if" clause for future condition)
```

**Trap 2: "Were" not "Was"**
```
❌ "If I was you, I would study."
✅ "If I WERE you, I would study."
(Subjunctive "were" for hypothetical Type 2)
```

**Trap 3: Unless ≠ If**
```
UNLESS = IF...NOT (no double negative)
❌ "Unless you don't study, you'll fail."
✅ "Unless you study, you'll fail."
```
