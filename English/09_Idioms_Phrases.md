# Understanding Idiomatic Expressions

## 🧠 The Mental Model: Idioms as Compressed Stories

```
An idiom is a PHRASE whose meaning is NOT the sum of its parts.

LITERAL: "He kicked the bucket" = He struck a bucket with his foot
IDIOMATIC: "He kicked the bucket" = He died

You can't DECODE idioms - you must KNOW them.
