# The 12 Tenses in Detail

## 1. SIMPLE PRESENT

### Structure
```
AFFIRMATIVE: Subject + V1 (add s/es for he/she/it)
NEGATIVE: Subject + do/does + not + V1
QUESTION: Do/Does + Subject + V1?
```

### Uses

| Use | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Habits/Routines | She **goes** to gym daily. |
| Permanent truths | The sun **rises** in the east. |
| Scheduled events | The train **leaves** at 5 PM. |
| Commentary/narration | He **passes** the ball... |
| Universal facts | Water **boils** at 100°C. |

### 🔑 Signal Words
`always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never, every day/week/month, daily, weekly`

### 🚨 TRAP: Subject-Verb Agreement with Third Person
```
✅ He plays (not play)
✅ She writes (not write)
✅ It works (not work)
```

---

## 2. PRESENT CONTINUOUS

### Structure
```
AFFIRMATIVE: Subject + am/is/are + V-ing
NEGATIVE: Subject + am/is/are + not + V-ing
QUESTION: Am/Is/Are + Subject + V-ing?
```

### Uses

| Use | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Action happening NOW | I **am writing** this answer. |
| Temporary situation | She **is staying** with her parents this month. |
| Future arrangement | We **are meeting** tomorrow. |
| Annoying habits (with always) | He **is always complaining**! |
| Changing situations | The climate **is getting** warmer. |

### 🔑 Signal Words
`now, at the moment, currently, right now, at present, today, this week, these days`

### 🚨 TRAP: Stative Verbs DON'T Take Continuous

**Stative verbs express states, not actions.** They are NOT normally used in continuous tenses:

```
MENTAL STATES: know, believe, understand, remember, forget, realize, recognize, think (opinion), suppose, doubt, mean

EMOTIONS: love, like, hate, prefer, want, wish, need, dislike, fear

POSSESSION: have, own, possess, belong

SENSES: see, hear, smell, taste, feel (perception, not active)

OTHER: seem, appear, cost, weigh, contain, consist of, owe, be
```

**Examples**:
```
❌ I am knowing the answer.       ✅ I know the answer.
❌ She is loving him.             ✅ She loves him.
❌ This book is costing ₹500.     ✅ This book costs ₹500.
❌ I am understanding now.        ✅ I understand now.
```

**EXCEPTION**: When the verb has a different (action) meaning:

```
"I think she's right." (opinion - stative) → Simple
"I'm thinking about the problem." (mental process - action) → Continuous

"She has a car." (possession) → Simple
"She's having dinner." (eating - action) → Continuous

"This food tastes good." (quality - stative) → Simple
"I'm tasting the soup." (testing - action) → Continuous
```

---

## 3. PRESENT PERFECT

### Structure
```
AFFIRMATIVE: Subject + have/has + V3 (past participle)
NEGATIVE: Subject + have/has + not + V3
QUESTION: Have/Has + Subject + V3?
```

### Uses

| Use | Example | Key Insight |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Past action, present result | I **have lost** my keys. | I still don't have them now |
| Life experience | She **has visited** Paris. | At some point in her life till now |
| Just completed | He **has just finished** eating. | Very recent |
| Continuing situation | I **have lived** here for 5 years. | Started past, still true now |
| With superlatives | This is the best movie I **have ever seen**. | In my life until now |

### 🔑 Signal Words
```
FINISHED TIME NOT SPECIFIED: ever, never, already, yet, just, so far, until now, up to now, recently, lately

DURATION FROM PAST TO NOW: since, for
```

### 🚨 TRAP: "Since" vs "For"

```
SINCE + Point in time (when it started)
→ since 2020, since Monday, since morning, since I was young

FOR + Duration (how long)  
→ for 3 years, for a month, for 2 hours, for ages
```

**Common Error**:
```
❌ I have been working here since 3 years.
✅ I have been working here for 3 years.
✅ I have been working here since 2020.
```

### 🚨 TRAP: Present Perfect vs Simple Past

**Present Perfect**: Time NOT specified or still relevant
**Simple Past**: Time IS specified or over

```
✅ I have seen that movie. (sometime in my life)
✅ I saw that movie yesterday. (specific time = past)
❌ I have seen that movie yesterday. 

✅ She has worked here for 5 years. (still works here)
✅ She worked here for 5 years. (doesn't work here now)
```

**Quick Test**: If you can add "yesterday" or a specific time, use Simple Past.

---

## 4. PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS

### Structure
```
AFFIRMATIVE: Subject + have/has + been + V-ing
NEGATIVE: Subject + have/has + not + been + V-ing
QUESTION: Have/Has + Subject + been + V-ing?
```

### Uses

| Use | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Duration until now | She **has been studying** for 3 hours. |
| Recent activity (visible evidence) | Why are you sweating? I **have been running**. |
| Repeated action over time | I **have been calling** you all day. |

### 🔑 Signal Words
`for, since, all day, all morning, how long, lately, recently`

### Present Perfect vs Present Perfect Continuous

```
PRESENT PERFECT = Emphasizes COMPLETION/RESULT
"I have read 3 books this month." (Focus: 3 books done)

PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS = Emphasizes DURATION/PROCESS
"I have been reading for 2 hours." (Focus: 2-hour activity)
```

---

## 5. SIMPLE PAST

### Structure
```
AFFIRMATIVE: Subject + V2 (past form)
NEGATIVE: Subject + did + not + V1
QUESTION: Did + Subject + V1?
```

### Uses

| Use | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Completed action in past | She **visited** Mumbai last year. |
| Past habit (now changed) | He **smoked** when young. (doesn't now) |
| Series of past events | I **woke up**, **brushed**, and **left**. |
| Past state | She **was** very happy then. |

### 🔑 Signal Words
`yesterday, last (week/month/year), ago, in 1990, then, when, that day, at that time, once upon a time`

---

## 6. PAST CONTINUOUS

### Structure
```
AFFIRMATIVE: Subject + was/were + V-ing
NEGATIVE: Subject + was/were + not + V-ing
QUESTION: Was/Were + Subject + V-ing?
```

### Uses

| Use | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Action in progress at past time | At 9 PM, I **was watching** TV. |
| Interrupted action | I **was cooking** when she called. |
| Parallel actions | While she **was reading**, he **was sleeping**. |
| Setting a scene | The sun **was shining** and birds **were singing**. |

### 🔑 Signal Words
`while, when, as, at (time) yesterday, all day (yesterday)`

### The "When/While" Pattern

```
WHEN + Simple Past (short action that interrupts)
WHILE + Past Continuous (long action in progress)

"While I was walking, it started to rain."
         ↑ long action      ↑ interruption
         
"I was walking when it started to rain."
     ↑ long action    ↑ interruption
```

---

## 7. PAST PERFECT

### Structure
```
AFFIRMATIVE: Subject + had + V3
NEGATIVE: Subject + had + not + V3
QUESTION: Had + Subject + V3?
```

### Uses

| Use | Example |
|-----|---------|

| Experience before a past time | By 2020, he **had visited** 10 countries. |
| Third conditional (if clauses) | If I **had known**, I would have helped. |

### 🧠 The Mental Model: The "Double Past"

```
TIMELINE:
──────────────────────────────────────────────→ NOW
    ↑                  ↑                
    HAD LEFT          ARRIVED
    (earlier past)    (later past = reference point)

"When I arrived, she had already left."
```

### 🔑 Signal Words
`before, after, already, just, never, by the time, until, when (referring to sequence)`

### 🚨 TRAP: When to Use Past Perfect

**NOT needed when**: Sequence is clear from context or from "before/after"
```
✅ I ate breakfast before I left. (sequence clear from "before")
✅ I had eaten breakfast before I left. (also correct, emphasizes completion)
```

**NEEDED when**: The earlier action is mentioned second
```
✅ I reached the station. The train had left. (need "had" to show train left first)
```

| Formal statements | The meeting **will begin** at 10 AM. |

### 🔑 Signal Words
`tomorrow, next (week/year), soon, in the future, later`

### Will vs Going to

```
WILL = Spontaneous decision, prediction, promise
"I'll answer the phone." (deciding now)

# Tense Sequence Rules (Crucial for GATE/ESE)

## The Golden Rule of Sequence

**When the main clause is in PAST, the subordinate clause usually shifts back:**

| If main clause is PAST | Subordinate clause shifts to |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Simple Present → | Simple Past |
| Present Continuous → | Past Continuous |
| Present Perfect → | Past Perfect |
| Simple Past → | Past Perfect |
| Will → | Would |
| Can → | Could |
| May → | Might |

### Example
```
DIRECT: He says, "I am happy."
INDIRECT: He said that he was happy.

DIRECT: She said, "I will come."
INDIRECT: She said that she would come.
```

## 🚨 EXCEPTIONS: When NOT to shift

1. **Universal truths**:
```
She said that the earth is round. (not "was round")
```

2. **Historical facts**:
```
The teacher said that World War II ended in 1945.
```

3. **Habitual facts still true**:
```
He told me he works at Google. (if he still does)
```

# Common Examiner Traps

## Trap 1: Stative Verbs in Continuous

```
❌ I am knowing him for 5 years.
✅ I have known him for 5 years.
```

## Trap 2: Since + Duration

```
❌ She has lived here since 5 years.
✅ She has lived here for 5 years.
✅ She has lived here since 2018.
```

## Trap 3: Present Perfect with Past Time

```
❌ I have visited Delhi yesterday.
✅ I visited Delhi yesterday.
✅ I have visited Delhi many times.
```

## Trap 4: By the time + Future

```
❌ By the time he arrives, I will leave.
✅ By the time he arrives, I will have left.

(The "leaving" must be completed before the "arriving")
```

## Trap 5: Wish + Past Tenses

```
PRESENT WISH (unreal now): Wish + Past Simple
"I wish I knew the answer." (but I don't)
"I wish I were taller." (but I'm not) [Use "were" for all]

PAST WISH (regret about past): Wish + Past Perfect
"I wish I had studied harder." (but I didn't)
```

## 📊 Quick Identification Strategy

### Step 1: Identify the Time Frame
```
Is it PAST, PRESENT, or FUTURE?
Look for time markers: yesterday (past), now (present), tomorrow (future)
```

### Step 2: Identify the Aspect
```
SIMPLE = Basic fact, habit, or completed action
CONTINUOUS = In progress at that time
PERFECT = Completed before reference time
PERFECT CONTINUOUS = Duration leading up to reference time
```

### Step 3: Apply the Formula
```
Find the matching cell in the 3×4 grid
Verify with signal words
Check for traps (stative verbs, since/for, time specificity)
```
