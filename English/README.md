## 🧠 The "Aha Moment" Learning Philosophy

This material is built on the principle that **understanding beats memorization**:

```
MEMORIZATION: "The rule is X"
UNDERSTANDING: "The rule is X because of Y, which means in situation Z, you should think about W"
```

Each concept includes:
- ✅ **Why it exists** - The logical foundation
- ✅ **How it works** - Step-by-step mechanics  
- ✅ **When it applies** - Context and conditions
- ✅ **Where it fails** - Edge cases and exceptions
- ✅ **Quick tricks** - Pattern recognition for speed
