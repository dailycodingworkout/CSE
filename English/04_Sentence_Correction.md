# The Error Detection Framework

## 🧠 The Mental Model: The 5-Point Checklist

When you see a sentence correction question, run this mental checklist:

```
S.V.P.A.M - "Save PAM"

S - Subject-Verb Agreement
V - Verb Forms & Tenses
P - Pronouns & References
A - Adjectives/Adverbs & Comparisons
M - Modifiers & Parallelism
```

If you can't find the error in these five, check:
- Prepositions
- Articles
- Conjunctions
- Word Order
- Redundancy

---

# The 15 Most Tested Error Types

## 1. Subject-Verb Agreement Errors

### The Core Rule
```
SINGULAR SUBJECT → SINGULAR VERB
PLURAL SUBJECT → PLURAL VERB
```

### Common Traps

#### Trap 1.1: Words Between Subject and Verb

```
❌ The list of items ARE on the table.
✅ The list of items IS on the table.
[Subject = "list" (singular), not "items"]
```

**Strategy**: Mentally remove prepositional phrases to find the true subject.

#### Trap 1.2: "Along with" / "As well as" / "Together with"

```
❌ The CEO, along with his team, ARE attending.
✅ The CEO, along with his team, IS attending.
[These phrases don't make the subject plural]
```

#### Trap 1.3: Either/Or, Neither/Nor

```
Verb agrees with the CLOSER subject:
✅ Neither the teacher nor the students WERE present.
✅ Neither the students nor the teacher WAS present.
```

#### Trap 1.4: Collective Nouns

```
UNIT ACTION = Singular
"The team IS playing well."

INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS = Plural
"The team ARE arguing among themselves."
```

#### Trap 1.5: "The number" vs "A number"

```
THE number of students HAS increased. (specific = singular)
A number of students HAVE passed. (many = plural)
```

#### Trap 1.6: Each/Every/Either/Neither

```
✅ Each of the students HAS submitted.
✅ Every employee WAS given a bonus.
✅ Neither of them IS correct.
```

#### Trap 1.7: Distances/Time/Money as Units

```
✅ Ten kilometers IS a long distance.
✅ Three years IS a long time to wait.
✅ Fifty thousand rupees IS the price.
```

---

## 2. Verb Tense Errors

### Common Traps

#### Trap 2.1: Tense Consistency

```
❌ He went to the market and BUYS vegetables.
✅ He went to the market and BOUGHT vegetables.
[Maintain same tense for related actions]
```

#### Trap 2.2: Since/For Confusion

```
❌ I have been working here since 5 years.
✅ I have been working here FOR 5 years.
✅ I have been working here SINCE 2018.
```

#### Trap 2.3: Present Perfect with Specific Past Time

```
❌ I have visited Delhi yesterday.
✅ I VISITED Delhi yesterday.
```

#### Trap 2.4: Stative Verbs in Continuous

```
❌ I am knowing the answer.
✅ I KNOW the answer.

❌ She is owning a car.
✅ She OWNS a car.
```

---

## 3. Pronoun Errors

### Trap 3.1: Pronoun Case (Subject vs Object)

```
❌ Between you and I, this is wrong.
✅ Between you and ME, this is wrong.
[After prepositions, use object pronouns: me, him, her, us, them]

❌ Him and me went to the movie.
✅ HE and I went to the movie.
[Subject of verb = subject pronouns: I, he, she, we, they]
```

**Quick Test**: Remove the other person and check.
- "Me went" ❌ → "I went" ✅
- "Him went" ❌ → "He went" ✅

### Trap 3.2: Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement

```
❌ Everyone should bring THEIR book. (formal writing)
✅ Everyone should bring HIS OR HER book.
✅ All students should bring THEIR books. (alternative)
```

### Trap 3.3: Ambiguous Pronouns

```
❌ John told Peter that HE had made a mistake.
[Who made the mistake? Unclear]
✅ John told Peter that Peter had made a mistake.
```

### Trap 3.4: Who vs Whom

```
WHO = Subject (he/she does something)
WHOM = Object (something is done to him/her)

Quick test: Answer with he/him
"Who/Whom did you see?" → "I saw HIM" → WHOM
"Who/Whom called you?" → "HE called" → WHO
```

### Trap 3.5: Reflexive Pronouns

```
❌ Myself and John will attend.
✅ John and I will attend.

Use reflexive (myself, himself) only when subject = object:
✅ I hurt myself.
✅ He blamed himself.
```

---

## 4. Adjective/Adverb Errors

### Trap 4.1: Adjective vs Adverb After Linking Verbs

```
After LINKING verbs (be, seem, look, feel, taste, smell), use ADJECTIVES:

❌ She looks BEAUTIFULLY.
✅ She looks BEAUTIFUL.

❌ The food tastes WELL.
✅ The food tastes GOOD.

❌ I feel BADLY about it.
✅ I feel BAD about it.
```

### Trap 4.2: Comparative/Superlative Errors

```
COMPARING TWO → Use comparative (-er/more)
❌ Between the two, she is TALLEST.
✅ Between the two, she is TALLER.

COMPARING THREE+ → Use superlative (-est/most)
✅ Of all the students, she is TALLEST.

NO DOUBLE COMPARATIVES:
❌ more better, most fastest
✅ better, fastest
```

### Trap 4.3: Adjective Order

When multiple adjectives are used, follow this order:
```
Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose

"A beautiful large old rectangular brown French wooden bread box"
```

```

```
✅ This is different FROM that. (Standard)
✅ This is different THAN that. (Accepted in American English)
❌ This is different TO that. (Non-standard in formal writing)
```

### Trap 5.3: Double Comparatives

```
❌ This is more preferable.
✅ This is preferable. (preferable already means "more preferred")

❌ This is more superior.
✅ This is superior. (superior already means "more in quality")

Other words that don't take more/most:
unique, perfect, complete, absolute, infinite, universal
```

---

## 6. Parallelism Errors

## 🧠 Speed Strategy for Error Detection

### The 10-Second Scan

```
1. UNDERLINED VERBS → Check subject-verb agreement, tense
2. UNDERLINED PRONOUNS → Check case, agreement, reference
3. UNDERLINED COMPARISONS → Check parallel structure, correct form
4. UNDERLINED PREPOSITIONS → Check correct preposition choice
5. SEE "AND/OR" → Check parallelism
6. SEE "NOT ONLY/NEITHER" → Check correlative structure
7. SEE "-ING" AT START → Check for dangling modifier
8. SEE "THAN" → Check comparison structure
9. SEE "EACH/EVERY/EITHER" → Singular verb required
10. IF NOTHING FOUND → Answer might be "No Error"
```
