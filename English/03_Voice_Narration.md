# Part 1: Active & Passive Voice

## 🧠 The Mental Model: The Camera Angle

```
ACTIVE VOICE = Camera on the DOER
"The chef prepared the meal."
[Focus: Chef is doing something]

PASSIVE VOICE = Camera on the RECEIVER
"The meal was prepared by the chef."
[Focus: Something is being done to the meal]
```

## WHY Use Passive Voice?

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Doer unknown | "My wallet **was stolen**." (don't know who) |
| Doer unimportant | "The bridge **was built** in 1950." (focus on bridge) |
| Doer obvious | "The criminal **was arrested**." (obviously by police) |
| Formal/Scientific writing | "The experiment **was conducted**." |
| To be diplomatic | "Mistakes **were made**." (avoids blame) |

---

## The Transformation Formula

### Basic Structure
```
ACTIVE:  Subject (doer) + Verb + Object (receiver)
PASSIVE: Object (receiver) + be + V3 (past participle) + by Subject (doer)
```

### Step-by-Step Process

```
Step 1: Identify Subject, Verb, and Object in active sentence
Step 2: Move Object to subject position
Step 3: Change verb to "be" + past participle (V3)
Step 4: Add "by" + original subject (optional if obvious)
```

### Example Walkthrough
```
ACTIVE: "The dog bit the man."
          ↑        ↑      ↑
       Subject    Verb   Object

PASSIVE: "The man was bitten by the dog."
            ↑         ↑           ↑
         Object    be+V3    by+Subject
```

## Voice Transformation: All 12 Tenses

### The "Be" Transformation Rule

**Passive = Appropriate form of "be" + Past Participle (V3)**

| Tense | Active | Passive |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Simple Present** | writes | is/am/are written |
| **Present Continuous** | is writing | is being written |
| **Present Perfect** | has written | has been written |
| **Present Perfect Continuous** | has been writing | ❌ (rarely used) |
| **Simple Past** | wrote | was/were written |
| **Past Continuous** | was writing | was being written |
| **Past Perfect** | had written | had been written |
| **Past Perfect Continuous** | had been writing | ❌ (rarely used) |
| **Simple Future** | will write | will be written |
| **Future Continuous** | will be writing | ❌ (rarely used) |
| **Future Perfect** | will have written | will have been written |
| **Future Perfect Continuous** | will have been writing | ❌ (rarely used) |

### Complete Examples

| Tense | Active | Passive |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Simple Present | She **writes** letters. | Letters **are written** by her. |
| Present Continuous | She **is writing** letters. | Letters **are being written** by her. |
| Present Perfect | She **has written** letters. | Letters **have been written** by her. |
| Simple Past | She **wrote** letters. | Letters **were written** by her. |
| Past Continuous | She **was writing** letters. | Letters **were being written** by her. |
| Past Perfect | She **had written** letters. | Letters **had been written** by her. |
| Simple Future | She **will write** letters. | Letters **will be written** by her. |
| Future Perfect | She **will have written** letters. | Letters **will have been written** by her. |

## Modal Verbs in Passive

### Formula: Modal + be + V3

| Active | Passive |
|--------|---------|
| can write | can be written |
| could write | could be written |
| may write | may be written |
| might write | might be written |
| must write | must be written |
| should write | should be written |
| would write | would be written |
| ought to write | ought to be written |
| has to write | has to be written |
| is to write | is to be written |

### Examples
```
ACTIVE: You must complete this work.
PASSIVE: This work must be completed (by you).

ACTIVE: Someone should help him.
PASSIVE: He should be helped.
```

---

## Special Passive Constructions

### 1. Two-Object Verbs (Ditransitive)

Some verbs have two objects: Indirect Object (person) and Direct Object (thing)

```
ACTIVE: She gave me a book.
            ↑    ↑
           IO   DO

Two possible passives:
PASSIVE 1: I was given a book (by her).     [IO becomes subject]
PASSIVE 2: A book was given to me (by her). [DO becomes subject]
```

**Common two-object verbs**: give, tell, show, teach, send, offer, pay, ask, promise, allow

### 2. Phrasal Verbs

Keep the preposition attached:
```
ACTIVE: They laughed at him.
PASSIVE: He was laughed at. ✅ (not "He was laughed")

ACTIVE: Someone broke into the house.
PASSIVE: The house was broken into.
```

### 3. "Let" in Passive

```
ACTIVE: Let him go.
PASSIVE: Let him be allowed to go. 
         OR: He should be let go.
```

### 4. Imperative Sentences

```
ACTIVE: Close the door.
PASSIVE: Let the door be closed.
         OR: You are requested to close the door. (polite)

ACTIVE: Do not touch this.
PASSIVE: Let this not be touched.
         OR: This should not be touched.
```

### 5. Infinitives

```
ACTIVE: I want someone to help me.
PASSIVE: I want to be helped.

ACTIVE: He is to finish the work.
PASSIVE: The work is to be finished by him.
```

---

## 🚨 Common Traps in Voice

### Trap 1: Intransitive Verbs Cannot Be Made Passive

**Intransitive verbs** have no object → No passive possible

```
❌ "He was laughed." (laugh needs an object with preposition)
✅ "He was laughed at."

❌ "The accident was happened." (happen = intransitive, no object)
✅ "The accident happened."
```

**Common intransitive verbs** (no passive): happen, occur, arrive, die, sleep, go, come, fall, rise, appear, exist

### Trap 2: "By" Is Not Always Needed

When the doer is:
- Unknown: "The window was broken."
- Obvious: "He was arrested." (obviously by police)
- Unimportant: "The letter was posted."

### Trap 3: Stative Verbs in Passive

Some state verbs don't typically form meaningful passives:
```
❌ "The answer is been known by me."
✅ "I know the answer." (active preferred)
```

### Trap 4: "Get" Passive

Informal passive using "get" instead of "be":
```
"He got injured." = "He was injured."
"They got married." = "They were married."
```

---

# Part 2: Direct & Indirect Speech (Narration)

## 🧠 The Mental Model: The Reporter's Lens

```
DIRECT SPEECH = Exact quote, word-for-word
"She said, 'I am tired.'"
[Quoting exactly what was said]

INDIRECT SPEECH = Reporter's summary
"She said that she was tired."
[Reporting the meaning, not exact words]
```

---

## The Master Transformation Rules

### Rule 1: Tense Backshift (When reporting verb is PAST)

| Direct Speech | Indirect Speech |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Simple Present | → Simple Past |
| Present Continuous | → Past Continuous |
| Present Perfect | → Past Perfect |
| Simple Past | → Past Perfect |
| Past Continuous | → Past Perfect Continuous |
| Will | → Would |
| Can | → Could |
| May | → Might |
| Must (obligation) | → Had to |

### Examples of Tense Backshift

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| "I **am** hungry." | He said he **was** hungry. |
| "I **am eating**." | He said he **was eating**. |
| "I **have finished**." | He said he **had finished**. |
| "I **ate** breakfast." | He said he **had eaten** breakfast. |
| "I **was sleeping**." | He said he **had been sleeping**. |
| "I **will help**." | He said he **would help**. |
| "I **can swim**." | He said he **could swim**. |
| "I **may come**." | He said he **might come**. |

---

### Rule 2: Pronoun Changes

| Direct | Indirect (Speaker → Reporter) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| I | → he/she (or appropriate) |
| we | → they |
| you (object) | → him/her/me (context-dependent) |
| my | → his/her |
| our | → their |
| me | → him/her |
| us | → them |
| myself | → himself/herself |

### The Logic Behind Pronoun Change

```
DIRECT: She said, "I love my job."
        [From HER perspective: I = she, my = her]
        
INDIRECT: She said that she loved her job.
          [From REPORTER'S perspective]
```

---

### Rule 3: Time & Place Changes

| Direct | Indirect |
|--------|----------|
| now | → then |
| today | → that day |
| yesterday | → the previous day / the day before |
| tomorrow | → the next day / the following day |
| tonight | → that night |
| last week/month | → the previous week/month |
| next week/month | → the following week/month |
| ago | → before / earlier |
| here | → there |
| this | → that |
| these | → those |
| come | → go |

---

### Rule 4: Reporting Verbs

Different sentence types use different reporting verbs:

| Sentence Type | Reporting Verb Options |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Statement | said, told, stated, remarked, mentioned |
| Question | asked, inquired, wondered, wanted to know |
| Command | ordered, commanded, told (to) |
| Request | requested, asked |
| Suggestion | suggested, proposed |
| Advice | advised |
| Warning | warned, cautioned |
| Exclamation | exclaimed |

---

## Transformation by Sentence Type

**Direct**: He said, "I am going home."
**Indirect**: He said that he was going home.

```
Structure: Reporting verb + (that) + subject + verb (backshifted)
```

**"Say" vs "Tell"**:
```
SAY: He said that...       (no object, or "to + object")
     He said to me that...

TELL: He told me that...   (always needs an object)
      ❌ He told that...
```

---

### Type 2: Questions (Interrogatives)

#### Yes/No Questions

**Direct**: She asked, "Are you coming?"

```

**Note**: Remove the question mark; change to statement word order.

#### Wh-Questions

**Direct**: He asked, "Where do you live?"
**Indirect**: He asked where I lived.

```
Structure: Asked + wh-word + subject + verb (statement order)
```

**Examples**:

"When will you return?" → He asked when I would return.
"Why are you late?" → He asked why I was late.
```

---

### Type 3: Commands & Requests (Imperatives)

**Direct**: He said, "Go away."
**Indirect**: He ordered me to go away.

**Direct**: She said, "Please help me."
**Indirect**: She requested me to help her.

```
Structure: 
COMMAND: ordered/commanded + object + to + V1
REQUEST: requested/asked + object + to + V1
```

**Negative**:
```
"Don't touch it." → He told me not to touch it.
"Please don't go." → She requested me not to go.
```

---

### Type 4: Exclamations

**Direct**: She said, "What a beautiful painting!"
**Indirect**: She exclaimed that it was a very beautiful painting.

```

---

### Type 5: Suggestions

---

## 🚨 EXCEPTIONS: When NOT to Backshift

INDIRECT: Teacher said that the earth revolves around the sun.
(No backshift - still true)
```

INDIRECT: He said that World War II ended in 1945.
```

          She said that she lived in Mumbai. (if uncertain or changed)
```

### 5. Conditionals (Type 2 & 3)
```
DIRECT: "If I were you, I would accept."
INDIRECT: He said that if he were me, he would accept.
(No change in Type 2 conditional)

DIRECT: "If I had known, I would have come."
INDIRECT: He said that if he had known, he would have come.
(No change in Type 3 conditional)
```

### 6. Must (for logical deduction)
```
DIRECT: "He must be at home."
INDIRECT: She said that he must be at home. (no change)
(But "must" for obligation → "had to")
```
