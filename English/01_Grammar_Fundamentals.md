# Part 1: The 8 Parts of Speech

## The Mental Model: The Movie Crew Analogy 🎬

Think of a sentence as a movie being made:

| Part of Speech | Movie Role | Example |
|----------------|------------|---------|
| **Noun** | The Actors (who/what the story is about) | *dog, happiness, Mumbai* |
| **Pronoun** | The Stunt Doubles (replace actors) | *he, she, it, they* |
| **Verb** | The Action Director (what happens) | *run, think, is, become* |
| **Adjective** | The Costume Designer (describes actors) | *beautiful, three, angry* |
| **Adverb** | The Style Coach (describes how action happens) | *quickly, very, never* |
| **Preposition** | The Location Manager (shows relationships) | *in, on, at, between* |
| **Conjunction** | The Editor (joins scenes) | *and, but, because, although* |
| **Interjection** | The Sound Effects (emotions) | *Wow! Oops! Alas!* |

## 1.1 Nouns: The Foundation

### Types of Nouns

```
NOUN FAMILY TREE
├── Proper Nouns (specific names) → Elon Musk, India, Microsoft
├── Common Nouns (general names) → man, country, company  
├── Collective Nouns (groups) → team, flock, committee
├── Abstract Nouns (ideas/feelings) → love, freedom, intelligence
├── Material Nouns (substances) → gold, water, wood
└── Countable vs Uncountable
    ├── Countable → book, chair (use a/an, numbers)
    └── Uncountable → information, advice (no a/an, no plural)
```

### 🚨 TRAP ALERT: Uncountable Nouns

These words are ALWAYS singular (examiner favorites):

| Word | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Information | informations | information |
| Advice | advices | a piece of advice |
| Furniture | furnitures | furniture |
| Luggage | luggages | luggage |
| News | news are | news is |
| Scenery | sceneries | scenery |
| Machinery | machineries | machinery |
| Poetry | poetries | poetry |
| Stationery | stationeries | stationery |

**WHY?** These are mass nouns - you can't count them individually. You don't say "one furniture" just like you don't say "one water."

### Edge Case: Nouns That Change Meaning with Plural

| Singular | Meaning | Plural | Meaning |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Wood | Timber | Woods | Forest |
| Good | Benefit | Goods | Products |
| Custom | Habit | Customs | Import duties |
| Force | Strength | Forces | Army |
| Content | Satisfied (adj) | Contents | Inside items |

---

## 1.2 Pronouns: The Replacers

### The Pronoun Case System

```
                SUBJECT     OBJECT      POSSESSIVE    POSSESSIVE    REFLEXIVE
                (does)      (receives)  (before noun) (standalone)
1st Singular    I           me          my            mine          myself
1st Plural      we          us          our           ours          ourselves
2nd             you         you         your          yours         yourself/ves
3rd Singular    he/she/it   him/her/it  his/her/its   his/hers/its  himself/herself
3rd Plural      they        them        their         theirs        themselves
```

### 🚨 TRAP ALERT: Common Pronoun Errors

**Trap 1: Between you and I** ❌
- **Wrong**: Between you and I
- **Correct**: Between you and me
- **Why**: "Between" is a preposition; prepositions take object pronouns (me, not I)

**Trap 2: Him and me went** ❌
- **Wrong**: Him and me went to the store
- **Correct**: He and I went to the store
- **Quick Test**: Remove the other person. "Me went" sounds wrong; "I went" is correct.

**Trap 3: Its vs It's**
- **It's** = It is / It has (contraction)
- **Its** = Belonging to it (possessive)
- **Why no apostrophe?** Possessive pronouns never use apostrophes (his, hers, ours, theirs, its)

**Trap 4: Who vs Whom**
```
WHO = Subject (he/she/they do something)
WHOM = Object (something is done to him/her/them)

Quick Test: Answer the question
"Who/Whom did you call?" → I called HIM → WHOM
"Who/Whom called you?" → HE called → WHO
```

## 1.3 Verbs: The Action Core

### Verb Classification

```
VERBS
├── Action Verbs
│   ├── Transitive (need object) → She kicked THE BALL
│   └── Intransitive (no object) → She laughed
├── Linking Verbs (connect subject to description)
│   → is, am, are, was, were, seem, appear, become, feel, look, sound, taste, smell
└── Helping Verbs (assist main verb)
    ├── Primary → be, have, do
    └── Modal → can, could, may, might, will, would, shall, should, must
```

### 🧠 The "Linking Verb" Test

**Question**: Is "feel" a linking verb or action verb?

```
"She feels happy" → LINKING (describes her state)
"She feels the fabric" → ACTION (physical action)

TEST: Replace with "is/am/are". If it makes sense, it's linking.
"She is happy" ✅ = Linking
"She is the fabric" ❌ = Action
```

### Modal Verbs: Degrees of Certainty

```
CERTAINTY SCALE (highest to lowest):
must → will → would → should → can → could → may → might

"It must be true" = 95% certain
"It might be true" = 30% certain
```

---

## 1.4 Adjectives & Adverbs: The Modifiers

### Position Rules

**Adjectives**: Come BEFORE nouns (or after linking verbs)
```
A beautiful painting (before noun)
The painting is beautiful (after linking verb)
```

**Adverbs**: More flexible, but follow patterns
```
She spoke softly (after verb)
She quickly finished (before verb - for emphasis)
Fortunately, we arrived (start of sentence - for the whole sentence)
```

### 🚨 TRAP ALERT: Adjective vs Adverb After Linking Verbs

**Question**: "She looks beautiful" or "She looks beautifully"?

**Answer**: Beautiful (adjective)

**WHY?** 
- "Looks" here is a LINKING verb (connecting her to a description)
- After linking verbs, use adjectives, not adverbs
- "She looks beautifully" would mean "her eyes perform the action of looking in a beautiful manner"

**Similar traps**:
- The food smells **good** ✅ (not "well" - unless you mean it has a working nose)
- I feel **bad** ✅ (not "badly" - unless your fingers can't sense properly)
- She seems **nervous** ✅ (not "nervously")

### Comparison Degrees

| Type | Rule | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| One syllable | Add -er/-est | tall → taller → tallest |
| Two syllables ending in y | Change y to i, add -er/-est | happy → happier → happiest |
| Two+ syllables | Use more/most | beautiful → more beautiful → most beautiful |
| Irregular | Memorize | good → better → best |

**Irregular Comparisons to Memorize**:
```
good → better → best
bad → worse → worst
little → less → least
much/many → more → most
far → farther/further → farthest/furthest
old → older/elder → oldest/eldest
late → later/latter → latest/last
```

## 1.5 Prepositions: The Relationship Builders

### The Mental Model: Prepositions as GPS Coordinates

Prepositions tell you WHERE, WHEN, or HOW things relate to each other.

### Time Prepositions

```
AT - Specific point in time
   → at 5 o'clock, at noon, at midnight, at night, at the weekend (British)

ON - Specific days/dates
   → on Monday, on 15th August, on Independence Day, on my birthday

IN - Longer periods
   → in June, in 2024, in the morning, in the 21st century, in winter
```

### 🚨 TRAP ALERT: No Preposition Cases

**Never use preposition before**:
- yesterday, today, tomorrow
- last/next + time word
- this/that + time word
- every + time word

```
❌ on yesterday     ✅ yesterday
❌ in next week     ✅ next week  
❌ at every Monday  ✅ every Monday
❌ in this morning  ✅ this morning (but "in the morning")
```

### Place Prepositions

```
AT - Specific point/location
   → at the door, at the corner, at home, at work, at university

ON - Surface/line
   → on the table, on the wall, on page 5, on the road

IN - Enclosed space/area
   → in the box, in India, in the room, in the newspaper
```

### Common Preposition Combinations (Must Memorize)

| Word | Correct Preposition |
|------|---------------------|
| Agree | with (person), to (proposal), on (issue) |
| Congratulate | on |
| Depend | on |
| Consist | of |
| Differ | from (things), with (people) |
| Prefer | to (not than) |
| Averse | to |
| Addicted | to |
| Abide | by (rules), with (person) |
| Abstain | from |

---

# Part 2: Subject-Verb Agreement

> **The Golden Rule**: The verb must agree with its subject in number (singular/plural)

## The Core Principle

```
SINGULAR SUBJECT → SINGULAR VERB
PLURAL SUBJECT → PLURAL VERB

The dog runs. (singular + singular)
The dogs run. (plural + plural)
```

## 🧠 The "Ignore the Noise" Strategy

The key to mastering subject-verb agreement is identifying the TRUE subject by ignoring:
- Prepositional phrases
- Relative clauses
- Parenthetical expressions

```
"The box of chocolates IS on the table"
          ↑ noise    ↑ true subject is "box" (singular)
          
"The players, along with their coach, ARE practicing"
                    ↑ noise           ↑ Wait! "along with" doesn't add to subject
                                      
CORRECT: "The players, along with their coach, ARE practicing"
```

## 🚨 TRAP ALERT: Tricky Subject-Verb Agreement Cases

### Trap 1: "Along with" / "As well as" / "Together with"

These DON'T make the subject plural:
```
The manager, along with the employees, WAS present. ✅
(Subject is "manager" - singular)

Compare with:
The manager AND the employees WERE present. ✅
(AND joins them into a plural subject)
```

### Trap 2: Either/Or, Neither/Nor

**Rule**: Verb agrees with the CLOSER subject

```
Neither the teacher nor the students WERE ready.
Neither the students nor the teacher WAS ready.
                              ↑ closer subject
```

### Trap 3: Collective Nouns

```
UNIT = Singular verb
"The team IS performing well." (acting as one unit)

INDIVIDUALS = Plural verb
"The team ARE arguing among themselves." (acting separately)
```

### Trap 4: Indefinite Pronouns

**Always Singular**: each, either, neither, everyone, someone, anyone, no one, everybody, somebody, anybody, nobody, everything, something, anything, nothing

```
Everyone IS here. ✅
Neither of the answers IS correct. ✅
Each of the students HAS a book. ✅
```

**Always Plural**: both, few, many, several

```
Many WERE absent. ✅
Few HAVE understood. ✅
```

**Depends on the noun**: some, any, all, most, none

```
Some of the water IS spilled. (water = uncountable = singular)
Some of the books ARE missing. (books = countable plural = plural)
```

### Trap 5: Numerical Expressions

```
SINGLE UNIT = Singular
"Ten kilometers IS a long distance."
"Two hours IS enough time."
"Five thousand rupees IS the fee."

INDIVIDUAL ITEMS = Plural  
"Ten people WERE injured."
```

### Trap 6: "The number" vs "A number"

```
THE number of students IS increasing. (specific quantity = singular)
A number of students HAVE passed. (many students = plural)
```

---

# Part 3: Articles & Determiners

## The Mental Model: Articles as Introduction Levels

```
A/AN = "Let me introduce someone new to you" (First mention, non-specific)
THE = "You already know who I'm talking about" (Specific, known)
Ø (no article) = "We're speaking generally" (Abstract or plural general)
```

## A vs AN: The Sound Rule (Not Spelling!)

```
A + Consonant SOUND → a university, a European, a one-rupee coin
AN + Vowel SOUND → an hour, an honest man, an MBA, an X-ray
```

### 🚨 Edge Cases

| Word | Article | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| hour | AN hour | Silent 'h' → starts with vowel sound 'ow' |
| honest | AN honest | Silent 'h' |
| university | A university | Starts with 'yu' consonant sound |
| uniform | A uniform | Starts with 'yu' consonant sound |
| European | A European | Starts with 'yu' consonant sound |
| one | A one | Starts with 'w' consonant sound |
| MBA | AN MBA | Starts with 'em' vowel sound |
| SBI | AN SBI | Starts with 'es' vowel sound |
| UFO | A UFO | Starts with 'yu' consonant sound |

## When to Use THE (Specific Reference)

### Use THE when:

1. **Second mention**: "I saw a dog. THE dog was brown."
2. **Unique things**: the sun, the moon, the earth, the world
3. **Superlatives**: the best, the tallest, the most beautiful
4. **Ordinals**: the first, the second, the last
5. **Known from context**: "Close the door." (the door in this room)
6. **Inventions/Species**: The computer changed the world. The lion is a wild animal.
7. **Names with Republic/Kingdom/States**: The USA, The UK, The Republic of India
8. **Mountain ranges/Oceans/Rivers/Deserts**: The Himalayas, The Pacific, The Ganges, The Sahara
9. **Newspapers**: The Times, The Hindu
10. **Musical instruments**: play the guitar, the piano

### DON'T Use THE with:

1. **Proper nouns** (names): India (not The India), Mumbai, Mount Everest
2. **Languages**: English, Hindi (not The English language - unless specifying)
3. **Meals**: breakfast, lunch, dinner
4. **Games/Sports**: cricket, football, chess
5. **Subjects**: Mathematics, Physics (but: the study of physics)
6. **Days/Months**: Monday, January
7. **Abstract nouns used generally**: Love is beautiful. Honesty is the best policy.
8. **Plural nouns used generally**: Dogs are loyal. Books are useful.

# Part 4: Sentence Structure

## The Five Basic Sentence Patterns

```
1. S + V
   "Birds fly."
   
2. S + V + O
   "She reads books."
   
3. S + V + C (Complement)
   "He is intelligent." (Linking verb + adjective/noun)
   
4. S + V + IO + DO (Two Objects)
   "She gave him a gift."
   (Indirect Object = receiver, Direct Object = thing given)
   
5. S + V + O + C (Object Complement)
   "They elected him president."
   (president describes the object "him")
```

## Sentence Types by Function

| Type | Purpose | Example | Punctuation |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Declarative | Makes a statement | She is a doctor. | Period (.) |
| Interrogative | Asks a question | Is she a doctor? | Question mark (?) |
| Imperative | Gives a command | Be a good doctor. | Period or exclamation |
| Exclamatory | Expresses emotion | What a great doctor! | Exclamation mark (!) |

## Sentence Types by Structure

```
SIMPLE: One independent clause
→ "The sun rises in the east."

COMPOUND: Two+ independent clauses joined by FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
→ "The sun was shining, but it was cold."

COMPLEX: Independent clause + dependent clause(s)
→ "Although it was raining, we went out." 

COMPOUND-COMPLEX: 2+ independent clauses + 1+ dependent clause
→ "Although it was late, she worked hard, and she finished the project."
```
