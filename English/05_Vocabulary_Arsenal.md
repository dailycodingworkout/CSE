# Part 1: Word Building - The DNA of Vocabulary

## 🧠 The Mental Model: Words Are Like LEGO Blocks

```
PREFIX + ROOT + SUFFIX = WORD

un     +  do   +  able  = undoable
pre    +  dict +  ion   = prediction
dis    +  agree+  ment  = disagreement
```

**Why This Matters**: If you know 50 roots + 30 prefixes + 20 suffixes, you can decode 1000+ words!

# Part 5: Vocabulary Learning Strategies

## 🧠 Strategy 1: The Context Method

Don't memorize words in isolation. Learn them in sentences.

```
WEAK: Ubiquitous = everywhere
STRONG: "In the digital age, smartphones have become ubiquitous - you see them everywhere, from rural villages to metropolitan cities."

├── credulous (easily believing)
├── incredulous (skeptical)
├── credit (trust)
├── discredit (damage trust)
├── creed (belief system)
└── credentials (proof of qualification)
```

## 🧠 Strategy 3: The Association Method

Link new words to memorable images or stories:

```
GREGARIOUS (sociable)
Association: "Greg" is GREGARIOUS - he's always at parties
Visual: Imagine a guy named Greg surrounded by friends

TACITURN (quiet, reserved)
Association: "Taci-TURN away from conversation"
Visual: A person turning away when someone tries to talk
```

## 🧠 Strategy 4: The Opposite Pairs Method

Learn antonyms together:

```
VERBOSE ←→ CONCISE
(wordy) ←→ (brief)

BENEVOLENT ←→ MALEVOLENT
(kind) ←→ (evil)

EPHEMERAL ←→ PERMANENT
(short-lived) ←→ (lasting)
