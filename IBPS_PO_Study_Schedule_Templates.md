- Preposition usage (good at, angry with, etc.)

**Practice Questions (Solve all 20):**
```
1. Each of the students (a)/ have submitted (b)/ their assignments (c)/ on time. (d)
   Error: (b) - Should be "has submitted" (Each = singular)

2. She is very good (a)/ in mathematics (b)/ and scores well (c)/ in exams. (d)  
   Error: (b) - Should be "good at mathematics"
```

#### Afternoon Session: Simple Interest Mastery
**Formula Deep-Dive:**
```
Basic: SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Derived: P = (SI × 100)/(R × T)
Derived: R = (SI × 100)/(P × T)  
Derived: T = (SI × 100)/(P × R)
```

**Practice 25 Questions - All Types:**
```
Type 1: Basic SI
Q: SI on ₹8000 at 15% for 3 years?
Sol: (8000 × 15 × 3)/100 = ₹3600

Type 2: Finding Time
Q: In how many years will ₹5000 give SI of ₹3000 at 10%?
Sol: T = (3000 × 100)/(5000 × 10) = 6 years

Type 3: Amount Problems
Q: Amount after 4 years on ₹6000 at 12% SI?
Sol: SI = (6000 × 12 × 4)/100 = ₹2880
Amount = 6000 + 2880 = ₹8880
```

#### Evening Session: Coded Inequalities
**Master All Symbol Patterns:**
```

---

### Day 3: Vocabulary Building + Compound Interest

... (continue with 25 more)
```

#### Afternoon Session: Compound Interest Mastery
**All CI Formulas & Shortcuts:**
```
Basic: CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]
For 2 years: CI = P[R/100 + (R/100)²]
For 3 years: CI = SI of first year + SI of first 2 years + CI on CI

Difference Formula:
CI - SI (2 years) = P(R/100)²
CI - SI (3 years) = P(R/100)²(300 + R)/100
```

**Practice 20 Advanced Problems:**
```
Q: Difference between CI and SI on ₹10000 for 2 years at 20%?
Sol: Difference = 10000(20/100)² = 10000 × 0.04 = ₹400

Q: Amount becomes ₹6400 in 2 years and ₹7040 in 3 years at CI. Find rate?
Sol: CI for 3rd year = 7040 - 6400 = ₹640
This CI = 20% of amount after 2 years = 640 = 20% of 6400
So rate = 10% per annum
```

#### Evening Session: Direction Sense
**Master 8-Direction System:**
```
Primary: N, S, E, W
Secondary: NE, NW, SE, SW
Turn Rules: Right = Clockwise, Left = Anti-clockwise

**Practice 4 Long Passages** (150+ words each)

#### Afternoon Session: Time & Work Complete Mastery
**All Work Formulas:**
```
Basic: Work = Rate × Time
Combined: 1/A + 1/B = 1/Combined time
Ratio method: If A:B = 3:2 work ratio, then time ratio = 2:3

Advanced:
Work and Wages: Wage ratio = Work rate ratio
Efficiency: If A is 25% more efficient than B, then A:B = 5:4
```

**Practice 30 Problems - All Types:**
```
Type 1: Basic combined work
Q: A finishes work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Together in how many days?
Sol: Combined rate = 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6, so 6 days

Type 2: Work and wages  
Q: A, B, C finish work in 6, 8, 12 days. Total wages ₹2400. Find each share.
Sol: Work ratio = 4:3:2, so wages = ₹1067, ₹800, ₹533

Type 3: Efficiency problems
Q: A is 50% more efficient than B. Together they finish in 4 days. A alone?
Sol: A:B efficiency = 3:2, combined rate = 5 units/day
Total work = 20 units, A's rate = 3 units/day, so A alone = 20/3 = 6⅔ days
```

4. Among (3+), between (2)
5. Since (point of time), for (duration)
... (continue with 15 more patterns)
```

**Solve 40 Error Detection Questions**

#### Afternoon Session: Time, Speed & Distance
**All TSD Formulas:**
```
Basic: Speed = Distance/Time
Unit conversion: km/h × 5/18 = m/s
Relative speed: Same direction = subtract, opposite = add

Train formulas:
Cross pole = Train length/speed  
Cross platform = (Train + platform)/speed
Cross another train = (Both lengths)/(relative speed)
```

**Practice 25 Problems:**
```
Q: 120m train crosses 180m platform in 15 seconds. Find speed?
Sol: Total distance = 300m, Time = 15s
Speed = 300/15 = 20 m/s = 72 km/h

Q: Two trains 100m each, speeds 60 km/h and 40 km/h, cross in opposite direction?
Sol: Relative speed = 100 km/h = 100×5/18 = 250/9 m/s
Time = 200/(250/9) = 7.2 seconds
```

**Practice 15 Para Jumble Sets**

#### Afternoon Session: Profit & Loss Mastery
**Complete P&L Formulas:**
```
Basic: Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100
Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100
MP after discount: SP = MP × (100-D)/100

Advanced:
Successive discounts: Single discount = D1 + D2 - (D1×D2)/100
False weight: Profit% = (Error in weight/True weight) × 100
```

**Practice 30 P&L Problems:**
```
Q: Article sold for ₹920 after 20% and 15% successive discounts. Find MP?
Sol: Let MP = x
After discounts: SP = x × 80/100 × 85/100 = 0.68x
0.68x = 920, so x = ₹1353 (approximately)

Q: Trader uses 900g weight instead of 1kg. Find profit%?
Sol: Profit% = (100/900) × 100 = 11.11%
```
