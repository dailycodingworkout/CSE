## 📊 Key Formulas at a Glance

### Range Calculations:

| Representation | n-bit Range | Min Value | Max Value |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Unsigned** | 0 to 2ⁿ - 1 | 0 | 2ⁿ - 1 |
| **Sign-Magnitude** | -(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) to +(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) | -(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) | 2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1 |
| **1's Complement** | -(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) to +(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) | -(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) | 2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1 |
| **2's Complement** | -2ⁿ⁻¹ to +(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) | -2ⁿ⁻¹ | 2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1 |

### IEEE 754 Single Precision:
```
Value = (-1)^S × 1.M × 2^(E-127)

Where:
- S = Sign bit (1 bit)
- E = Exponent (8 bits, biased by 127)
- M = Mantissa (23 bits, normalized with hidden bit)
```
