## 3. Keyword Decoding System

### Male Indicators
- Father, Son, Brother, Uncle, Nephew, Grandfather, Grandson, Husband
- "He", "Him", "His"

### Female Indicators
- Mother, Daughter, Sister, Aunt, Niece, Grandmother, Granddaughter, Wife
- "She", "Her", "Hers"

### Gender-Neutral Terms
- **Child**: Could be Son or Daughter
- **Parent**: Could be Father or Mother
- **Sibling**: Could be Brother or Sister
- **Cousin**: Could be Male or Female
- **Spouse**: Could be Husband or Wife

### The "Only" Keyword
> **"Only son/daughter"** means no other children of that gender
> **"Only child"** means no siblings at all

---

## 4. Generation Mapping Technique

### The +/- System

```
Generation Level:
+2: Grandparents (Grandfather, Grandmother)
+1: Parents (Father, Mother, Uncle, Aunt, In-laws of parents' generation)
 0: Self (You, Siblings, Cousins, Spouse, Brother/Sister-in-law)
-1: Children (Son, Daughter, Nephew, Niece, Children-in-law)
-2: Grandchildren (Grandson, Granddaughter)
```

### How to Use
1. Assign your reference person as **Generation 0**
2. Move **UP (+)** for older generations
3. Move **DOWN (-)** for younger generations
4. Track both **generation** and **gender**

### Example
```
"A is the father of B, B is the sister of C, C is the husband of D"

Step 1: A is father of B → A is +1, B is 0
Step 2: B is sister of C → C is 0 (sibling of B, B is female)
Step 3: C is husband of D → D is 0 (spouse of C, C is male)

Result: A is father-in-law of D
```

---

## 5. The Family Tree Method (Visual Approach)

### Symbols Convention

```
Male:    □ (Square)
Female:  ○ (Circle)
Unknown: △ (Triangle)

Marriage: ═══ (Double line connecting)
Parent-Child: │ (Vertical line)
Siblings: ─── (Horizontal line connecting)
```

### Step-by-Step Tree Building

**Step 1:** Read all statements once
**Step 2:** Identify the "anchor" person (usually appears most frequently)
**Step 3:** Draw relationships one by one
**Step 4:** Mark gender clearly
**Step 5:** Verify with each statement

### Example Construction

```
Statement: "P is the mother of Q. R is the husband of P. S is the brother of Q."

        □ R ═══ ○ P
                │
        ┌───────┴───────┐
        △ Q             □ S
```

## 6. Coded Blood Relations

### Common Coding Patterns

**Symbol-Based:**
- A + B → A is father of B
- A - B → A is mother of B
- A × B → A is brother of B
- A ÷ B → A is sister of B
- A = B → A is spouse of B

**Letter-Based:**
- A $ B → A is parent of B
- A # B → A is sibling of B
- A @ B → A is child of B

### Decoding Strategy
1. **Create a legend** from given code definitions
2. **Decode step by step**, don't rush
3. **Draw family tree** as you decode
4. **Double-check** final relationship

### Example
```
Given Codes:
A + B means A is the father of B
A - B means A is the mother of B
A × B means A is the brother of B

Question: If P + Q × R - S, how is P related to S?

Solution:
- P + Q: P is father of Q
- Q × R: Q is brother of R
- R - S: R is mother of S

Tree:
        □ P
        │
    ┌───┴───┐
    □ Q     ○ R
            │
            △ S

P is grandfather of S (P is male, two generations above S)
```

## 7. Pointing to Person Problems

### Key Phrases
- "Pointing to a photograph..."
- "Pointing to a man/woman..."
- "Introducing someone..."

### Strategy
1. Identify who is **pointing** (Person A)
2. Identify who is being **pointed at** (Person B)
3. Decode the relationship statement
4. Trace back to find final relation

### Classic Examples

**Example 1:**
"Pointing to a photograph, Ram said, 'He is the son of my father's only son.'"

**Decode:**
- My father's only son = Ram himself (if Ram is the only son)
- Son of Ram = Ram's son
**Answer:** The person in photo is Ram's son

**Example 2:**
"Pointing to a lady, Raj said, 'She is the daughter of the only child of my grandmother.'"

**Decode:**
- My grandmother's only child = Raj's parent (father or mother)
- Daughter of that parent = Raj's sister
**Answer:** The lady is Raj's sister

---

## 8. "Only" Statement Analysis

### "Only Son" vs "Only Child"
```
"Only son" → No brothers, may have sisters
"Only daughter" → No sisters, may have brothers
"Only child" → No siblings at all
```

### "Only Son of my Father"
If speaker says "father's only son":
- The speaker IS that person (if male)
- Or the person is the speaker's brother (if speaker is female)

### Example
```
"A is the only son of B"
→ B has no other sons
→ B may have daughters

"A is the only child of B"
→ B has no other children
→ A has no siblings
```

## 9. Common Traps & Edge Cases

### Trap 1: Gender Assumption
```
Wrong: Assuming "parent" is always father
Right: Parent can be father OR mother - check context
```

### Trap 2: Cousin Gender
```
Wrong: Assuming cousin is same gender as subject
Right: Cousin can be male or female - explicitly check
```

### Trap 3: In-Law Confusion
```
Brother-in-law could be:
1. Spouse's brother
2. Sister's husband
3. Spouse's sister's husband
```

### Trap 4: Step-Relationships
```
Step-mother = Father's wife who is not biological mother
Step-brother = Step-parent's son from previous marriage
```

### Trap 5: "Myself" Reference
```
"Father's only son's son" where father has only one son = 
If speaker is male → Speaker's son
If speaker is female → Brother's son
```

## 10. Matrix Method for Complex Problems

### When to Use
- Multiple people (5+)
- Multiple relationships
- Missing information gaps

### Setup
1. Create matrix with names on both axes
2. Mark known relationships
3. Derive unknown relationships
4. Look for contradictions

### Example Matrix
```
        A    B    C    D
    ┌────────────────────
A   │  -   Fa   ?   GF
B   │  So  -    Br  ?
C   │  ?   Si   -   ?
D   │  GS  ?    ?   -

Legend: Fa=Father, So=Son, Br=Brother, Si=Sister, GF=Grandfather, GS=Grandson
```

## 11. Puzzle-Based Blood Relations

### Characteristics
- Given set of statements
- Multiple conditions to satisfy
- Usually 3-5 questions from one puzzle

### Strategy: ABCD Method

**A - Analyze:** Read all conditions, identify constraints
**B - Build:** Start building family tree
**C - Check:** Verify each condition is satisfied
**D - Derive:** Answer questions from final diagram

### Example Puzzle

**Given:**
1. There are 6 members in a family - P, Q, R, S, T, U
2. There are two married couples
3. P is father of Q and grandfather of U
4. R is grandmother of U
5. S is uncle of U
6. T is mother of U

**Solution:**
```
Step 1: P is grandfather of U, R is grandmother of U
        → P and R are married couple (grandparents)

Step 2: P is father of Q
        → Q is P's child

Step 3: T is mother of U, S is uncle of U
        → T is parent, S is sibling of T or T's spouse

Step 4: U is grandchild of P
        → U's parent is P's child
        → T is married to Q (P's child) or S is P's child

If T is married to Q:
        □ P ═══ ○ R
            │
        ┌───┴───────┐
        ? Q ═══ ○ T  ? S
            │
            △ U

For S to be uncle: S must be Q's sibling
So Q is P's son, S is P's son

Final: Q is male (father of U), S is male (uncle)
```

## 12. Shortcut Tricks

### Trick 1: The Backward Method
Start from the answer options and verify which fits.

### Trick 2: The Count Method
- Count generations UP and DOWN
- Match with relationship names

### Trick 3: The Line Method
```
For "A is related to B":
Draw line from A to B through family tree
Count: Each up = +1, Each down = -1
Check: Horizontal moves for siblings/spouses
```

### Trick 4: Gender Flip
If gender not specified, try both possibilities.

## 13. Practice Problems with Solutions

### Problem 1 (Basic)
**Statement:** "Pointing to a man in a photograph, Sunita said, 'His mother is the only daughter of my mother.'"

**Solution:**
- My mother's only daughter = Sunita herself
- His mother = Sunita
- So the man is Sunita's son

**Answer: Son**

---

### Problem 2 (Medium)
**Statement:** "A is the mother of B. B is the sister of C. D is the father of C. E is the son of D. How is E related to A?"

**Solution:**
```
Step 1: A is mother of B → A(F) → B
Step 2: B is sister of C → B(F) - C (siblings)
Step 3: D is father of C → D(M) → C, and also D → B
Step 4: D is father of B (since B and C are siblings)
Step 5: A is mother of B, D is father of B → A and D are married
Step 6: E is son of D → E is sibling of B and C
Step 7: A is mother of E

Family Tree:
    □ D ═══ ○ A
        │
    ┌───┼───┬───┐
    ○ B ○ C □ E

Answer: E is son of A (A is E's mother)
```

---

### Problem 3 (Coded)
**Given:**
- P × Q means P is brother of Q
- P + Q means P is father of Q
- P - Q means P is wife of Q
- P ÷ Q means P is daughter of Q

**Question:** If A ÷ B + C × D - E, how is A related to E?

**Solution:**
```
A ÷ B: A is daughter of B
B + C: B is father of C
C × D: C is brother of D
D - E: D is wife of E

Tree:
        □ B
        │
    ┌───┴───┐
    ○ A     □ C ─── ○ D ═══ □ E

Wait: D - E means D is wife of E, so D is female
C × D means C is brother of D, so both C and D are siblings
But C is son of B...

Revised:
        □ B
        │
    ┌───┴───────┐
    ○ A    □ C ─── ○ D ═══ □ E

A is B's daughter
C is B's son
D is C's sister = B's daughter
So A, C, D are siblings
D is married to E

A is E's sister-in-law (wife's sister)
```

**Answer: A is sister-in-law of E**

---

### Problem 4 (Complex Puzzle)
**Given:** 8 members in a family - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
1. A is grandmother of F
2. B is husband of G
3. C is mother of D
4. D is sister of E
5. E is son of B
6. F is nephew of D
7. G is daughter-in-law of A
8. H is father of D

**Solution:**
```
From 1, 7: A is grandmother, G is daughter-in-law of A
From 3, 4, 5: C is mother of D, D is sister of E, E is son of B
         → C and B are parents of D and E
From 2: B is husband of G
         → G = C (since B is also parent of D, E with C)

Hmm, conflict: G is daughter-in-law of A, but G = C who is mother of D...

Let's re-read:
- G is daughter-in-law of A (G married to A's son)
- B is husband of G (B is A's son)
- C is mother of D, E is son of B

So C and G are different people, or B has two relationships?

Actually: C is mother of D, B is father of E, D is sister of E
→ C and B are parents of both D and E

But: B is husband of G → G is B's wife
And: C is mother of D → C is also B's wife?

Resolution: C = G (same person)

From 8: H is father of D
But B is father of E, and D is sister of E...
So H = B (same person)

Final:
        ○ A
        │
        □ B(H) ═══ ○ G(C)
        │
    ┌───┴───┬───┐
    ○ D     □ E  ? F

F is nephew of D (D's sibling's son)
F is grandson (A is grandmother of F)
So F is son of E

    □ B ═══ ○ C(G)
        │
    ┌───┴───┐
    ○ D     □ E
            │
            □ F
```

## 16. The Mental Visualization

Imagine a **family tree growing in 3D space**:
- **Vertical axis**: Generations (up = older, down = younger)
- **Horizontal axis**: Siblings spread left-right
- **Depth axis**: Different family branches (in-laws)

As you read each statement, **watch the tree grow** in your mind.

---

## 17. The 5-Second Sanity Check

Before marking answer:
1. **Gender verified?** (Don't assume)
2. **Generation count correct?** (+1, -1, etc.)
3. **"Only" interpreted correctly?** 
4. **In-law vs blood relation distinguished?**
5. **All conditions satisfied?** (Re-check puzzle)
