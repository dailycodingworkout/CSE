## 📚 Core Concepts

### What is a Ratio?

**Ratio** = Comparison of two quantities of the same kind

```
a : b = a/b (read as "a is to b")
```

**💡 Analogy**: Ratio is like a recipe - "2 parts flour to 1 part sugar" = 2:1

**Key Properties**:
- Order matters: 2:3 ≠ 3:2
- No units (pure number)
- Both quantities must be positive
- Can be scaled: 2:3 = 4:6 = 6:9

---

### What is Proportion?

**Proportion** = Equality of two ratios

```
a : b = c : d  OR  a/b = c/d

Written as: a : b :: c : d
Read as: "a is to b as c is to d"
```

**Key Terms**:
- a, d = Extremes (outer terms)
- b, c = Means (inner terms)

---

## 📐 Fundamental Formulas

### Cross Multiplication Rule

If a : b = c : d, then:
```
a × d = b × c   (Product of extremes = Product of means)
```

---

### Types of Proportion

**1. Mean Proportion (Geometric Mean)**
If a : x = x : b, then x is mean proportion
```
x² = ab
x = √(ab)
```

**2. Third Proportion**
If a : b = b : c, then c is third proportion
```
c = b²/a
```

**3. Fourth Proportion**
If a : b = c : d, then d is fourth proportion
```
d = bc/a
```

---

## 🔗 Essential Properties of Ratios

### Property 1: Componendo

If a/b = c/d, then:
```
(a+b)/b = (c+d)/d
```

---

### Property 2: Dividendo

If a/b = c/d, then:
```
(a-b)/b = (c-d)/d
```

---

### Property 3: Componendo-Dividendo

If a/b = c/d, then:
```
(a+b)/(a-b) = (c+d)/(c-d)
```

**⚡ Super useful for competitive exams!**

---

### Property 4: Invertendo

If a/b = c/d, then:
```
b/a = d/c
```

---

### Property 5: Alternendo

If a/b = c/d, then:
```
a/c = b/d
```

---

### Property 6: Addition/Subtraction of Equal Ratios

If a/b = c/d = e/f = k, then:
```
(a+c+e)/(b+d+f) = k

(a-c+e)/(b-d+f) = k (any combination)
```

---

## 📊 Types of Ratio Problems

### Type 1: Finding Ratio

**Example**: A = 30, B = 45. Find A:B
```
A:B = 30:45 = 2:3
```

**⚡ Always simplify** by dividing both by HCF.

---

### Type 2: Combining Ratios

**When one quantity is common**:
A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:B:C

```
Make B equal in both:
A:B = 2:3 = 8:12
B:C = 4:5 = 12:15

A:B:C = 8:12:15
```

**⚡ Trick**: 
```
A:B:C = (A:B × B:C first term) : (B common) : (B:C × A:B second term)
      = 2×4 : 3×4 : 3×5 = 8:12:15
```

---

### Type 3: Dividing a Quantity in Given Ratio

**Divide N in ratio a:b:c**:
```
First part = N × a/(a+b+c)
Second part = N × b/(a+b+c)
Third part = N × c/(a+b+c)
```

**Example**: Divide 120 in ratio 2:3:5
```
Parts = 120 × 2/10, 120 × 3/10, 120 × 5/10
      = 24, 36, 60
```

---

### Type 4: Finding Original Quantities from Ratio

**Given**: A:B = 3:5, A + B = 160. Find A and B.
```
Total parts = 3 + 5 = 8
A = 160 × 3/8 = 60
B = 160 × 5/8 = 100
```

---

### Type 5: Ratio Changes

**Given**: Original A:B = 2:3. If A increases by 10 and B decreases by 5, new ratio = 3:4. Find original values.
```
Let A = 2x, B = 3x
(2x + 10)/(3x - 5) = 3/4
4(2x + 10) = 3(3x - 5)
8x + 40 = 9x - 15
x = 55
A = 110, B = 165
```

---

## ⚖️ Direct vs Inverse Proportion

### Direct Proportion

When one increases, other increases proportionally.
```
If A ∝ B, then A = kB (k = constant)
A₁/A₂ = B₁/B₂
```

**Examples**: Distance ∝ Speed (time constant), Cost ∝ Quantity

---

### Inverse Proportion

When one increases, other decreases proportionally.
```
If A ∝ 1/B, then A × B = k (constant)
A₁ × B₁ = A₂ × B₂
A₁/A₂ = B₂/B₁
```

**Examples**: Speed ∝ 1/Time (distance constant), Workers ∝ 1/Days (work constant)

---

### Combined Proportion

```
If A ∝ B and A ∝ 1/C, then A ∝ B/C
A = k × B/C
```

**Example**: Work done ∝ (Men × Days) / Difficulty

---

## 👥 Partnership Problems

### Simple Partnership (Same Time)

If A and B invest for **same time period**:
```
Profit share A : Profit share B = Investment A : Investment B
```

---

### Compound Partnership (Different Times)

If A invests ₹P₁ for T₁ months, B invests ₹P₂ for T₂ months:
```
Profit share A : Profit share B = P₁×T₁ : P₂×T₂
```

**Example**: A invests ₹5000 for 8 months, B invests ₹6000 for 10 months
```
Ratio = 5000×8 : 6000×10 = 40000 : 60000 = 2:3
```

---

### Working Partner

If one partner works + invests:
```
Working partner gets salary + share of remaining profit
```

---

## 📐 Variation Problems

### Joint Variation

```
If A varies directly with B and inversely with C:
A ∝ B/C
A = k × B/C

To find k: Use given values
```

**Example**: A = 12 when B = 4, C = 2. Find A when B = 6, C = 3.
```
k = A × C/B = 12 × 2/4 = 6
New A = 6 × 6/3 = 12
```

---

### Chain Rule

For problems involving multiple quantities:
```
A₁/A₂ = (all direct ratios) × (inverse of all inverse ratios)
```

**Example**: 15 men complete work in 20 days. How many days for 25 men?
```
Men ↑, Days ↓ (inverse)
15/25 = D₂/20
D₂ = 20 × 15/25 = 12 days
```

---

## 💡 Advanced Tricks

### Trick 1: Quick Ratio from Percentages

```
A is 20% more than B
A/B = 120/100 = 6/5
A : B = 6 : 5
```

---

### Trick 2: Finding Individual from Sum/Difference

Given A:B = 3:5 and A - B = 20:
```
Difference in parts = 5 - 3 = 2
Each part = 20/2 = 10
A = 30, B = 50
```

---

### Trick 3: Duplicate/Triplicate Ratios

```
Duplicate ratio of a:b = a²:b²
Triplicate ratio of a:b = a³:b³
Sub-duplicate ratio of a:b = √a:√b
Sub-triplicate ratio of a:b = ∛a:∛b
```

---

### Trick 4: Reciprocal Ratio

```
Reciprocal of a:b = b:a = 1/a : 1/b
```

---

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Traps

### Trap 1: Same Unit Required
```
❌ 2 kg : 500 g = 2:500
✅ 2000 g : 500 g = 4:1
```

### Trap 2: Order Matters
```
A:B = 2:3 means A < B
B:A = 3:2 means B > A
```

### Trap 3: Percentage vs Ratio Points
```
If A is 25% of B, then A:B = 1:4 (NOT 25:100 = 1:4, but different thinking)
If A:B = 1:4, then A is 25% of B, or A is 20% of (A+B)
```

### Trap 4: Addition/Subtraction of Ratios
```
2:3 + 3:4 ≠ 5:7
Ratios cannot be added like fractions without common entity
```

## 📝 GATE-Level Practice

**Q1**: If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:C
```
A:B = 8:12, B:C = 12:15
A:C = 8:15
```

**Q2**: Divide ₹3600 among A, B, C such that A gets 2/3 of what B gets and B gets 1/4 of what C gets.
```
Let C = x, then B = x/4, A = (2/3)(x/4) = x/6
A:B:C = x/6 : x/4 : x = 2:3:12
Total = 17 parts
A = 3600 × 2/17 ≈ 423.53
```

**Q3**: A and B invest in ratio 3:2. A is a working partner and gets 10% of profit as salary. If total profit is ₹5000, find their individual shares.
```
A's salary = 500
Remaining = 4500
A's share = 500 + 4500×3/5 = 500 + 2700 = ₹3200
B's share = 4500×2/5 = ₹1800
```

**Q4**: If (a+b):(a-b) = 3:1, find a:b
```
Using componendo-dividendo:
a/b = (3+1)/(3-1) = 4/2 = 2/1
a:b = 2:1
```
