## Fundamental Concepts

### Why Ratio & Proportion Matter?
This topic forms the backbone of:
- Mixture problems
- Partnership calculations
- Time-work-efficiency problems
- Data interpretation
- Engineering design calculations

### Basic Definitions

**Ratio:** Comparison of two quantities of the **same unit** by division.
$$a : b = \frac{a}{b}$$

**Proportion:** Equality of two ratios.
$$a : b :: c : d \Leftrightarrow \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$$

### Key Terminology

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Antecedent** | First term of ratio | In 3:4, 3 is antecedent |
| **Consequent** | Second term of ratio | In 3:4, 4 is consequent |
| **Means** | Middle terms in proportion | In a:b::c:d, b and c |
| **Extremes** | Outer terms in proportion | In a:b::c:d, a and d |

### The Golden Rules

1. **Order matters:** $a : b \neq b : a$ (unless $a = b$)
2. **Same units:** Always convert to same units before forming ratio
3. **Simplest form:** Always reduce to lowest terms (HCF = 1)
4. **Scaling:** $a : b = ka : kb$ for any $k \neq 0$

---

## Types of Ratios

### 1. Simple Ratio
Direct comparison: $a : b$

### 2. Compound Ratio
Product of two or more ratios:
$$(a : b) \times (c : d) = ac : bd$$

**Example:** Compound of 2:3 and 4:5 = 8:15

### 3. Duplicate Ratio
Square of a ratio:
$$a^2 : b^2$$

**Example:** Duplicate of 3:4 = 9:16

### 4. Triplicate Ratio
Cube of a ratio:
$$a^3 : b^3$$

### 5. Sub-duplicate Ratio
Square root of a ratio:
$$\sqrt{a} : \sqrt{b}$$

### 6. Sub-triplicate Ratio
Cube root of a ratio:
$$\sqrt[3]{a} : \sqrt[3]{b}$$

### 7. Inverse/Reciprocal Ratio
Flip the ratio:
$$\frac{1}{a} : \frac{1}{b} = b : a$$

---

## Proportion

### Definition
If $a : b = c : d$, then a, b, c, d are in proportion.

### Fundamental Property

$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \Leftrightarrow ad = bc$$

> **💡 The Golden Pivot:** Product of extremes = Product of means

### Types of Proportion

#### 1. Continued Proportion
$a : b = b : c$

Here, $b^2 = ac$ → $b = \sqrt{ac}$ (b is **mean proportional**)

**Example:** Mean proportional of 4 and 9 = $\sqrt{4 \times 9} = 6$

#### 2. Third Proportional
If $a : b = b : x$, then x is the third proportional to a and b.
$$x = \frac{b^2}{a}$$

#### 3. Fourth Proportional
If $a : b = c : x$, then x is the fourth proportional.
$$x = \frac{bc}{a}$$

### Properties of Proportion

If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} = k$, then:

| Property | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Invertendo | $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{d}{c}$ |
| Alternendo | $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{d}$ |
| Componendo | $\frac{a+b}{b} = \frac{c+d}{d}$ |
| Dividendo | $\frac{a-b}{b} = \frac{c-d}{d}$ |
| Componendo-Dividendo | $\frac{a+b}{a-b} = \frac{c+d}{c-d}$ |
| Addendo | $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}$ |

---

## Variations

### 1. Direct Variation (Direct Proportion)
If $x \propto y$, then:
$$\frac{x_1}{y_1} = \frac{x_2}{y_2} = k \text{ (constant)}$$

**Example:** If 5 pens cost ₹30, then 8 pens cost:
$$\frac{5}{30} = \frac{8}{x} \Rightarrow x = ₹48$$

### 2. Inverse Variation (Inverse Proportion)
If $x \propto \frac{1}{y}$, then:
$$x_1 \times y_1 = x_2 \times y_2 = k$$

**Example:** If 6 workers do a job in 8 days, 4 workers will take:
$$6 \times 8 = 4 \times x \Rightarrow x = 12 \text{ days}$$

### 3. Joint Variation
When one variable depends on multiple variables:
$$z \propto \frac{x^a \cdot y^b}{w^c}$$

$$z = k \cdot \frac{x^a \cdot y^b}{w^c}$$

### 4. Partial Variation
When a quantity has fixed and variable parts:
$$y = a + bx$$

**Example:** Taxi fare = Fixed charge + Rate × Distance

## Partnership Problems

### Simple Partnership
All partners invest for the **same duration**:
$$\text{Profit Ratio} = \text{Investment Ratio}$$

### Compound Partnership
Partners invest for **different durations**:
$$\text{Profit Ratio} = (\text{Investment}_1 \times \text{Time}_1) : (\text{Investment}_2 \times \text{Time}_2)$$

### Working Partner
If one partner also works:
1. Deduct working partner's salary
2. Divide remaining profit in capital ratio

### Examples

**Example 1:** A and B invest ₹40,000 and ₹60,000. Profit is ₹15,000. Find shares.
- Ratio = 40000 : 60000 = 2 : 3
- A's share = 15000 × 2/5 = ₹6,000
- B's share = 15000 × 3/5 = ₹9,000

**Example 2:** A invests ₹10,000 for 12 months, B invests ₹15,000 for 8 months. Profit ratio?
- A : B = (10000 × 12) : (15000 × 8) = 120000 : 120000 = 1 : 1

## Mixtures and Alligation

### Mean Price
When different quantities at different prices are mixed:
$$\text{Mean Price} = \frac{\sum (\text{Quantity}_i \times \text{Price}_i)}{\sum \text{Quantity}_i}$$

### The Alligation Rule

For mixing two ingredients at prices $C_1$ and $C_2$ to get mixture at price $C_m$:

```
    C₁ (Cheaper)           C₂ (Dearer)
            \              /
             \            /
              \          /
               Cₘ (Mean)
              /          \
             /            \
            /              \
    (C₂ - Cₘ)            (Cₘ - C₁)
```

$$\frac{\text{Quantity of Cheaper}}{\text{Quantity of Dearer}} = \frac{C_2 - C_m}{C_m - C_1}$$

### Replacement Formula

If a vessel contains $x$ liters of liquid A, and $y$ liters is removed and replaced with liquid B, done $n$ times:

$$\text{Final amount of A} = x \left(1 - \frac{y}{x}\right)^n$$

**Example:** 64 liters of milk. 8 liters replaced with water 3 times. Milk remaining?
$$\text{Milk} = 64 \times \left(1 - \frac{8}{64}\right)^3 = 64 \times \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^3 = 64 \times \frac{343}{512} = 42.875 \text{ L}$$

## GATE & ESE Problem Patterns

### Pattern 1: Basic Ratio Problems
> If A:B = 3:4 and B:C = 5:6, find A:B:C.
- Make B common: A:B = 15:20, B:C = 20:24
- A:B:C = 15:20:24

### Pattern 2: Finding Individual Values
> Two numbers are in ratio 3:5 and their sum is 80. Find the numbers.
- 3x + 5x = 80 → 8x = 80 → x = 10
- Numbers: 30 and 50

### Pattern 3: Age Problems with Ratios
> The present ages of A and B are in ratio 5:4. Five years ago, the ratio was 4:3. Find present ages.
- Present: 5x and 4x
- Five years ago: (5x-5):(4x-5) = 4:3
- 3(5x-5) = 4(4x-5)
- 15x - 15 = 16x - 20
- x = 5
- Ages: 25 and 20 years

### Pattern 4: Income-Expenditure Ratio
> Ratio of incomes of A and B is 3:4. Ratio of expenditures is 2:3. Each saves ₹1000. Find incomes.
- Income: 3x, 4x; Expenditure: 2y, 3y
- 3x - 2y = 1000 ... (i)
- 4x - 3y = 1000 ... (ii)
- Solving: x = 1000, y = 1000
- Incomes: ₹3000 and ₹4000

### The 2026 Adversarial Vault

**The Inversion (Common Mistake):**
"If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, what is A:C?"

Wrong approach: Just multiplying 2×4 : 3×5 = 8:15

**The Elegant Solution:**
- A:B = 2:3 → A = 2k, B = 3k for some k
- B:C = 4:5 → B = 4m, C = 5m for some m
- Equate B: 3k = 4m → k/m = 4/3
- A = 2k = 2(4) = 8, C = 5m = 5(3) = 15
- A:C = **8:15**

(In this case, the answer happens to be 8:15, but the method matters for variations!)

**MSQ Logic Gate:**
- When combining ratios, the common term must be made equal
- Ratio answers should be in lowest terms

**NAT Precision Lock:**
- If ratio is 2.5:3.5, multiply by 2 to get 5:7
- Always express final answer as integers unless decimals are specified

## Speed Tricks & Shortcuts

### Trick 1: The LCM Method for Combining Ratios

To find A:B:C when given A:B and B:C:
1. Find LCM of the two B values
2. Multiply each ratio to make B equal
3. Combine

### Trick 2: Direct Component Addition

If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} = k$, then $\frac{a+c}{b+d} = k$

This is incredibly useful for quick calculations!

### Trick 3: Alligation Cross-Multiplication

For mixtures, draw the X pattern:
```
C₁ ——————→ (C₂ - Cₘ)
      ×
Cₘ ——————→ Answer
      ×
C₂ ——————→ (Cₘ - C₁)
```

### Trick 4: Ratio to Percentage

If ratio is a:b, then:
- First quantity = $\frac{a}{a+b} \times 100\%$
- Second quantity = $\frac{b}{a+b} \times 100\%$

### Trick 5: Finding Original Quantity

If after adding/removing x, ratio changes from a:b to c:d:
Set up equation and solve (usually gives quadratic or linear)

## Permanent Recall

### The Bizarre Mnemonic (Alligation)
*"The alligation is a wrestling match: Cheaper and Dearer fight, and Mean stands in the middle as referee. The distance each fighter is from the ref shows how weak they are in the mix!"*

### The Mental Slider
Imagine a see-saw:
- Left side: Cheaper item (heavier = more quantity)
- Right side: Dearer item (lighter = less quantity)
- Fulcrum: Mean price
- Balance point shows the ratio!

### The 5-Second Snap-Check
- Ratio sum should match the given total (if applicable)
- In alligation, cheaper is always in higher quantity if mean is closer to cheaper price
- Product of means = Product of extremes (always verify)

1. Sum of ratio = 3+5+9 = 17
   - First part = 1870 × 3/17 = **₹330**
   - Second part = 1870 × 5/17 = **₹550**
   - Third part = 1870 × 9/17 = **₹990**

2. A:B = 2:3, B:C = 4:5, C:D = 6:7
   Make chain: A:B:C:D
   - A:B = 2:3 → 8:12 (multiply by 4)
   - B:C = 4:5 → 12:15 (multiply by 3)
   - C:D = 6:7 → 15:17.5 (multiply by 2.5)
   
   Actually, let's use fractions:
   - A/D = (A/B) × (B/C) × (C/D) = (2/3) × (4/5) × (6/7) = 48/105 = **16:35**

3. Fourth proportional: 3:5 = 12:x
   x = 5 × 12/3 = **20**

4. Let alloys be mixed in ratio x:y.
   Copper: (3/7)x + (5/7)y; Zinc: (4/7)x + (2/7)y
   Ratio = 2:1
   (3x + 5y)/(4x + 2y) = 2/1
   3x + 5y = 8x + 4y
   y = 5x
   Ratio = **1:5**

5. A's salary = 10% of 9600 = ₹960
   Remaining profit = 9600 - 960 = ₹8640
   A's share of remaining = 8640 × 3/5 = ₹5184
   A's total = 960 + 5184 = **₹6144**

6. Milk remaining = 60 × (1 - 6/60)³ = 60 × (54/60)³ = 60 × (0.9)³ = 60 × 0.729 = **43.74 L**

7. Let investments be a, b, c
   a×12 : b×9 : c×8 = 1:1:1 (equal profit)
   12a = 9b = 8c = k
   a = k/12, b = k/9, c = k/8
   a : b : c = 1/12 : 1/9 : 1/8 = 6:8:9
   Total = 36000, so:
   A = 36000 × 6/23 ≈ ₹9391
   B = 36000 × 8/23 ≈ ₹12522
   C = 36000 × 9/23 ≈ ₹14087
   Ratio = **6:8:9**

8. Let incomes = 9x, 7x; Expenditures = 4y, 3y
   9x - 4y = 2000 ... (i)
   7x - 3y = 2000 ... (ii)
   Multiply (i) by 3: 27x - 12y = 6000
   Multiply (ii) by 4: 28x - 12y = 8000
   Subtract: x = 2000
   A's income = 9 × 2000 = **₹18,000**

9. Water costs ₹0/L, Wine costs ₹60/L, Mixture ₹40/L
   Using alligation:
   Water : Wine = (60-40) : (40-0) = 20:40 = **1:2**
