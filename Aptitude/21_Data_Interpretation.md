## 📚 Part 1: Types of Data Representation

### Tables

Numerical data organized in rows and columns.

**Example**:
| Year | Sales (₹ Cr) | Profit (₹ Cr) |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 2019 | 150 | 30 |
| 2020 | 180 | 35 |
| 2021 | 220 | 45 |

**Reading Tips**:
- Identify row/column headers
- Note units (thousands, lakhs, crores)
- Look for trends and patterns

---

### Bar Graphs

Rectangular bars representing data magnitudes.

**Types**:
- **Simple bar**: One data series
- **Grouped bar**: Multiple series side by side
- **Stacked bar**: Components stacked on each other

**Reading Tips**:
- Check axis scales carefully
- Compare bar heights/lengths
- Note if scale starts at 0 (truncated scales can mislead)

---

### Line Graphs

Data points connected by lines, showing trends over time.

**Reading Tips**:
- Slope indicates rate of change
- Steeper slope = faster change
- Look for turning points, maxima, minima

---

### Pie Charts

Circular chart divided into sectors representing proportions.

**Key Formula**:
```
Sector angle = (Value/Total) × 360°
Percentage = (Sector angle/360°) × 100%
```

**Reading Tips**:
- Larger sector = higher proportion
- All sectors sum to 100% or 360°
- Compare relative sizes

---

### Mixed/Combination Charts

Multiple chart types combined.

**Example**: Bar graph with a line overlay showing trend.

---

## 📐 Essential Calculation Skills

### Percentage Calculations

```
% of a value = (Percentage/100) × Value
% change = ((New - Old)/Old) × 100
```

**Quick Approximations**:
```
10% of X = X/10
5% of X = X/20
1% of X = X/100
25% of X = X/4
50% of X = X/2
```

---

### Ratio Calculations

```
Ratio A:B means A/B = ratio
If A:B = 3:4 and B = 80, then A = 80 × (3/4) = 60
```

---

### Average

```
Average = Sum of values / Number of values
```

---

### Growth Rate

**Simple Growth**:
```
Growth rate = ((Final - Initial)/Initial) × 100%
```

**CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**:
```
CAGR = [(Final/Initial)^(1/n) - 1] × 100%
```

---

## 📊 Standard Problem Types

### Type 1: Direct Reading

Simply read values from the chart/table.

**Example**: What was the sales in 2020?
```
Read directly from table: ₹180 Cr
```

---

### Type 2: Comparison

Compare two or more data points.

**Example**: By how much did sales increase from 2019 to 2020?
```
Increase = 180 - 150 = ₹30 Cr
```

---

### Type 3: Percentage Change

**Example**: What is the percentage increase in sales from 2019 to 2021?
```
% increase = ((220-150)/150) × 100 = (70/150) × 100 = 46.67%
```

---

### Type 4: Ratio/Proportion

**Example**: What is the ratio of profit to sales in 2020?
```
Ratio = 35:180 = 7:36
```

---

### Type 5: Finding Averages

**Example**: What is the average annual sales for 2019-2021?
```
Average = (150 + 180 + 220)/3 = 550/3 = ₹183.33 Cr
```

---

### Type 6: Maximum/Minimum

**Example**: In which year was profit margin (Profit/Sales) highest?
```
2019: 30/150 = 20%
2020: 35/180 = 19.4%
2021: 45/220 = 20.45%
Highest: 2021
```

---

### Type 7: Projections/Estimates

**Example**: If sales increase by 15% in 2022 compared to 2021, what will be 2022 sales?
```
2022 Sales = 220 × 1.15 = ₹253 Cr
```

---

### Type 8: Pie Chart Calculations

**Example**: If total revenue is ₹500 Cr and Product A represents 72°, what is Product A's revenue?
```
Revenue = (72/360) × 500 = ₹100 Cr
```

## 💡 Speed Calculation Tricks

### Trick 1: Fraction to Percentage

| Fraction | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| 1/2 | 50% |
| 1/3 | 33.33% |
| 1/4 | 25% |
| 1/5 | 20% |
| 1/6 | 16.67% |
| 1/8 | 12.5% |
| 1/10 | 10% |

---

### Trick 2: Percentage Change Shortcut

```
From A to B: % change = (B-A)/A × 100

Quick: (Difference/Original) × 100
```

---

### Trick 3: Multiplicative Approximations

```
Instead of 247 × 38:
≈ 250 × 38 = 9500
Or ≈ 247 × 40 = 9880
Actual: 9386
```

---

### Trick 4: Division Simplification

```
3456/72 = 3456/(8×9) = 432/9 = 48
Or: 3456/72 ≈ 3500/70 = 50
```

---

### Trick 5: Percentage of Percentage

```
30% of 40% of 500
= 0.3 × 0.4 × 500
= 0.12 × 500 = 60
```

## 📈 Data Analysis Strategies

### Strategy 1: Understand the Data First

Before answering questions:
1. Read all labels, titles, legends
2. Understand units (thousands, lakhs, etc.)
3. Note the time period or categories
4. Identify any data gaps or anomalies

---

### Strategy 2: Estimate Before Calculate

Quick approximation helps:
1. Avoid silly mistakes
2. Choose between close options
3. Save time on complex calculations

---

### Strategy 3: Use Options Wisely

If options are far apart:
- Approximation sufficient
- Work backwards from options

If options are close:
- Careful calculation needed
- Double-check arithmetic

---

### Strategy 4: Look for Patterns

Common patterns in data:
- Increasing/decreasing trends
- Seasonal variations
- Proportional relationships
- Outliers

---

## ⚠️ Common Traps & Pitfalls

### Trap 1: Unit Confusion
```
Values in lakhs ≠ Values in crores
Always check units before calculating
```

### Trap 2: Truncated Y-Axis
```
Bar graph not starting from 0
Makes small differences look large
```

### Trap 3: Percentage OF vs Percentage Point
```
10% to 15% is a 5 percentage POINT increase
But it's a 50% increase (5/10 × 100)
```

### Trap 4: Base Year Confusion
```
"Increase over previous year" ≠ "Increase over first year"
Check what the base is
```

### Trap 5: Missing Data
```
Some questions may have incomplete data
May need to use multiple sources
```

---

## 📊 Complex Data Sets

### Caselets

Multiple paragraphs of text containing numerical data.

**Approach**:
1. Read completely first
2. Note key numbers and relationships
3. Organize in a table or diagram
4. Answer questions systematically

---

### Multiple Interrelated Tables/Charts

Data spread across multiple representations.

**Approach**:
1. Understand the link between representations
2. Identify which data comes from where
3. Cross-reference carefully
4. Double-check calculations
