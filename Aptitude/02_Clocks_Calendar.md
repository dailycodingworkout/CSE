# Clocks & Calendar | The Singularity

**The Atomic Truth:** Angular displacement governs all time problems.

## Part A: CLOCKS

### The Path of Elegance (The Root Derivation)

**The Golden Pivot:** Relative angular velocity between hands.

#### Fundamental Angular Velocities

| Hand | Speed | Per Minute | Per Hour |
|------|-------|------------|----------|
| Hour Hand | $\frac{360°}{12 \text{ hr}}$ | $0.5°/\text{min}$ | $30°/\text{hr}$ |
| Minute Hand | $\frac{360°}{60 \text{ min}}$ | $6°/\text{min}$ | $360°/\text{hr}$ |
| Second Hand | $\frac{360°}{60 \text{ sec}}$ | $360°/\text{min}$ | — |

#### The Master Equation

**Relative Speed (Minute vs Hour):**
The relative angular velocity (ω) represents how fast the minute hand gains on the hour hand:
$$\omega_{rel} = 6° - 0.5° = 5.5°/\text{min}$$

**Angle between hands at time $h:m$:**
$$\theta = \left| 30h - 5.5m \right|$$

If $\theta > 180°$, use $360° - \theta$ for acute angle.

## The 2026 Adversarial Vault (CLOCKS)

### ⚠️ TRAP #1: The Reflex Angle Trap
**The Inversion:** Forgetting that clock shows TWO angles.
- At any position, angle can be $\theta$ or $360° - \theta$
- Question usually asks for **smaller** angle
- **ALWAYS check if $\theta > 180°$**

### ⚠️ TRAP #2: The "Between" Time Trap
**The Inversion:** "Between 3 and 4" means hour hand is NOT exactly at 3.

At 3:00, hour hand = $90°$ from 12
At 3:30, hour hand = $90° + 15° = 105°$ from 12

**Hour hand position = $30h + 0.5m$**

### ⚠️ TRAP #3: The Coincidence Trap
**Critical Insight:** Hands coincide **11 times** in 12 hours, NOT 12!
- They coincide every $\frac{12}{11} \times 60 = 65\frac{5}{11}$ minutes
- No coincidence between 11-12 and 12-1 (only at 12:00)

## 🔥 MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY QUESTIONS (CLOCKS)

### Question 1: The Angle at Non-Standard Time [GATE Pattern]

**Problem:**
At what time between 2 and 3 o'clock are the clock hands at an angle of exactly 60°?

**Options:**
(A) 2:00 only  
(B) 2:21:49 only  
(C) 2:00 and 2:21:49  
(D) 2:10:54 only

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Master Equation:**

**Step 1: Set up equation**
$$\theta = \left| 30h - 5.5m \right| = 60°$$

At $h = 2$:
$$\left| 60 - 5.5m \right| = 60$$

**Step 2: Solve for both cases**

**Case 1:** $60 - 5.5m = 60$
$$5.5m = 0$$
$$m = 0$$

Time: **2:00**

**Case 2:** $60 - 5.5m = -60$
$$5.5m = 120$$
$$m = \frac{120}{5.5} = \frac{240}{11} = 21\frac{9}{11} ≈ 21.82$$

Convert to seconds: $\frac{9}{11} × 60 ≈ 49$ seconds

Time: **2:21:49**

**Step 3: Verify both answers**
- At 2:00: $|60 - 0| = 60°$ ✓
- At 2:21:49: $|60 - 5.5(21.82)| = |60 - 120| = 60°$ ✓

**Answer: (C) 2:00 and 2:21:49**

---

### Question 2: The Coincidence Problem [ESE Pattern]

**Problem:**
At what time between 7 and 8 o'clock will the hour and minute hands coincide?

**Options:**
(A) 7:38:11  
(B) 7:38:18  
(C) 7:38:02  
(D) 7:35:00

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Coincidence Formula:**

**Step 1: Apply formula**
For coincidence: $\theta = 0$
$$30h - 5.5m = 0$$
$$m = \frac{30h}{5.5} = \frac{60h}{11}$$

**Step 2: Calculate for h = 7**
$$m = \frac{60 \times 7}{11} = \frac{420}{11} = 38\frac{2}{11}$$

**Step 3: Convert fraction to seconds**
$$\frac{2}{11} \text{ min} = \frac{2}{11} \times 60 = \frac{120}{11} = 10.909 \text{ sec} ≈ 11 \text{ sec}$$

**Answer: (A) 7:38:11**

---

### Question 3: The Mirror Problem [PSU Pattern]

**Problem:**
A clock shows 3:40. What time will be shown by its mirror image?

**Options:**
(A) 8:20  
(B) 9:20  
(C) 8:40  
(D) 9:40

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Mirror Formula:**

**The Mirror Rule:**
$$\text{Mirror Time} = 11:60 - \text{Actual Time}$$

(Use 12:00 for times after 11:30)

**Step 1: Apply formula**
$$\text{Mirror} = 11:60 - 3:40 = 8:20$$

**Verification:**
- At 3:40: Hour hand near 3.67, Minute hand at 8
- In mirror: positions flip horizontally
- Mirror shows ~8:20 ✓

**Answer: (A) 8:20**

---

### Question 4: The Perpendicular Hands [Extreme]

**Problem:**
How many times in a day do the hour and minute hands make a 90° angle?

**Options:**
(A) 22  
(B) 44  
(C) 24  
(D) 48

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Counting Principle:**

**Step 1: Analyze 12-hour cycle**
- Hands are perpendicular at 90° and 270°
- This happens **22 times** in 12 hours
- (Similar to coincidence: 11 times for 0°, 11 times for 180°, total 22 for any specific angle pair)

**Step 2: Calculate for 24 hours**
$$22 \times 2 = 44$$

**Answer: (B) 44**

## Part B: CALENDAR

### The Path of Elegance (The Root Derivation)

**The Golden Pivot:** Odd days calculation.

#### Fundamental Rules

**Odd Days** = Remainder when total days ÷ 7

| Period | Total Days | Odd Days |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Ordinary Year | 365 | 1 |
| Leap Year | 366 | 2 |
| 100 years | 36525* | 5 |
| 200 years | — | 3 |
| 300 years | — | 1 |
| 400 years | 146097 | 0 |

*Assuming 24 leap years in 100 years

#### The Leap Year Formula
A year is a leap year if:
1. Divisible by 4, AND
2. NOT divisible by 100, OR
3. Divisible by 400

$$\text{Leap} = (Y \mod 4 = 0) \land ((Y \mod 100 \neq 0) \lor (Y \mod 400 = 0))$$

---

## The 2026 Adversarial Vault (CALENDAR)

### ⚠️ TRAP #1: The Century Year Trap
**The Inversion:** Assuming all century years are leap years.
- 1900 → NOT leap (divisible by 100, not by 400)
- 2000 → LEAP (divisible by 400)
- 2100 → NOT leap

### ⚠️ TRAP #2: The February 29 Trap
**Critical Case:** When calculating days from January to March in a leap year:
- Include Feb 29 only if the period CROSSES February 29
- "From Jan 15 to Mar 15" in leap year = 60 days (not 59)

### ⚠️ TRAP #3: The "Same Day" Trap
**The Inversion:** Same date falls on same day after:
- Ordinary year: Next year + 1 day
- Leap year: Next year + 2 days
- **NOT simple 7-year cycle!**

## 🔥 MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY QUESTIONS (CALENDAR)

### Question 5: The Century Calculation [GATE Pattern]

**Problem:**
If January 1, 2024 is Monday, what day is January 1, 2100?

**Options:**
(A) Monday  
(B) Friday  
(C) Wednesday  
(D) Thursday

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Odd Days Method:**

**Step 1: Calculate years from 2024 to 2100**
Total years = 76 years (2024 to 2099)

**Step 2: Count leap years in this range**
Leap years: 2024, 2028, 2032, ..., 2096
Using AP: $n = \frac{2096 - 2024}{4} + 1 = 19$

**Note:** 2100 is NOT a leap year (century rule)

**Step 3: Calculate odd days**
- Ordinary years: $76 - 19 = 57$ → Odd days = 57
- Leap years: 19 → Odd days = $19 \times 2 = 38$
- Total odd days = $57 + 38 = 95$

**Step 4: Find remainder**
$$95 \mod 7 = 4$$

**Step 5: Count forward from Monday**
Monday + 4 = Friday

**Answer: (B) Friday**

### Question 6: The Recurring Pattern [ESE Pattern]

**Problem:**
In which year will the calendar of 2024 repeat exactly?

**Options:**
(A) 2052  
(B) 2040  
(C) 2030  
(D) 2035

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Calendar Cycle:**

**The Rule:** Calendar repeats when total odd days = 0 (or 7)

**Step 1: 2024 is a leap year**
For a leap year calendar to repeat, next occurrence must also be a leap year starting on same day.

**Step 2: Calculate odd days from 2024**

| Year | Type | Odd Days | Cumulative |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| 2024 | Leap | 2 | 2 |
| 2025 | Ord | 1 | 3 |
| 2026 | Ord | 1 | 4 |
| 2027 | Ord | 1 | 5 |
| 2028 | Leap | 2 | 7 → 0 |

After 2028, we're back to 0 odd days, but 2028 is a leap year too!

**Check:** Does 2024 calendar = 2028 calendar?
- 2024: Jan 1 = Monday, Leap year
- 2028: Jan 1 = Monday + 0 = Monday? 

**Wait!** We need to count odd days for 2024 only to reach Jan 1, 2025.

**Correct Method:**
From Jan 1, 2024 to Jan 1, 2025 = 366 days (leap) = 2 odd days
From Jan 1, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026 = 365 days = 1 odd day

Cumulative:
- End of 2024: 2
- End of 2025: 3
- End of 2026: 4
- End of 2027: 5
- End of 2028: 7 → 0
- ...continuing...

We need cumulative = 7 (or 14, 21...) AND target year must be leap.

After 28 years from a leap year, the calendar repeats.
2024 + 28 = 2052

**Answer: (A) 2052**

### Question 7: The Day Calculation [PSU Pattern]

**Problem:**
What day of the week was July 4, 1776?

**Options:**
(A) Thursday  
(B) Friday  
(C) Wednesday  
(D) Monday

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Reference Point:**

**Reference:** January 1, 0001 AD = Monday (assumed)

**Step 1: Count years**
From year 1 to 1775 = 1775 years

**Step 2: Count complete centuries**
- 1600 years = 4 × 400 = 0 odd days
- 100 years (1601-1700) = 5 odd days
- 75 years (1701-1775):
  - Leap years: 1704, 1708, ..., 1772 = 18 leap years
  - Ordinary years: 75 - 18 = 57
  - Odd days = 57 + 36 = 93 → 93 mod 7 = 2

**Step 3: Days in 1776 till July 4**
- Jan: 31
- Feb: 29 (1776 is leap)
- Mar: 31
- Apr: 30
- May: 31
- Jun: 30
- Jul 1-4: 4

Total = 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 186 days
Odd days = 186 mod 7 = 4

**Step 4: Total odd days**
$$0 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 \mod 7 = 4$$

**Step 5: Count from Monday**
Monday + 4 = Thursday

**Answer: (A) Thursday**

### Question 8: The Tricky Range [Extreme]

**Problem:**
How many times does February have 5 Sundays in the years from 2000 to 2100 (inclusive)?

**Options:**
(A) 4  
(B) 5  
(C) 3  
(D) 2

---

**🎯 SOLUTION via Leap Year + Sunday Start:**

**Condition for Feb to have 5 Sundays:**
1. Must be a leap year (Feb = 29 days)
2. Feb 1 must be Sunday

**Step 1: Find leap years (2000-2100)**
2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2096 (NOT 2100!)
Count = 25 leap years

**Step 2: Find which have Feb 1 = Sunday**

We need to track day of Feb 1 for each leap year.

**Feb 1, 2000:** Calculate from reference
- 2000 is divisible by 400 → Jan 1, 2000 = Saturday (known)
- Jan 2000 has 31 days
- Feb 1, 2000 = Saturday + 31 mod 7 = Saturday + 3 = Tuesday

**Pattern for Feb 1 in leap years:**
Each leap year to next: 4 years = 4 + 1 = 5 odd days (approximately)

Actually: 3 ordinary + 1 leap = 3(1) + 2 = 5 odd days

Feb 1 progresses by 5 days every 4 years.

Feb 1 days:
- 2000: Tuesday
- 2004: Tuesday + 5 = Sunday ✓
- 2008: Sunday + 5 = Friday
- 2012: Friday + 5 = Wednesday
- 2016: Wednesday + 5 = Monday
- 2020: Monday + 5 = Saturday
- 2024: Saturday + 5 = Thursday
- 2028: Thursday + 5 = Tuesday
- 2032: Tuesday + 5 = Sunday ✓
- ...

**Pattern:** Sunday appears every 28 years from 2004.
- 2004 ✓
- 2032 ✓
- 2060 ✓
- 2088 ✓

**Answer: (A) 4**
