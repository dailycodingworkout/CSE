# Chapter 6: Data Interpretation | The Analytical Singularity

## **The Atomic Truth:** *Extract, Compare, Compute—in that order.*

---

## 1. Foundation: What is Data Interpretation?

Data Interpretation (DI) tests your ability to:
- Read and understand data presented in tables, charts, and graphs
- Extract relevant information quickly
- Perform calculations and draw conclusions
- Compare and analyze trends

### Why This Matters for GATE/ESE/PSU/BANK:
- **GATE:** 2-3 questions in General Aptitude (high importance)
- **ESE:** Appears in Paper-1
- **Banks (IBPS/SBI):** 10-15 questions per paper (very high weightage)
- **PSU:** Standard section in all aptitude tests
- **SSC:** Core component of quantitative section

---

## 2. Types of Data Representation

### **Type 1: Tables**

Raw numerical data organized in rows and columns.

**Example:**
| Year | Sales (₹Cr) | Profit (₹Cr) | Employees |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 2020 | 150 | 25 | 500 |
| 2021 | 180 | 32 | 550 |
| 2022 | 210 | 40 | 600 |

### **Type 2: Bar Graphs**

Rectangular bars representing quantities.

**Subtypes:**
- Simple bar graph
- Grouped/Clustered bar graph
- Stacked bar graph

### **Type 3: Line Graphs**

Points connected by lines showing trends over time.

**Subtypes:**
- Single line
- Multiple lines (comparison)
- Cumulative line

### **Type 4: Pie Charts**

Circular representation showing parts of a whole (percentages).

### **Type 5: Mixed/Caselets**

Paragraph-based data requiring inference and multiple steps.

---

## 3. The DI Strategy Framework

### **Phase 1: Scan (10-15 seconds)**

Before reading questions:
1. What type of graph/table is this?
2. What does each axis/column represent?
3. What are the units?
4. What is the time period or category range?

### **Phase 2: Question Analysis (5 seconds per question)**

1. What data points are needed?
2. What calculation is required?
3. Are there shortcuts possible?

### **Phase 3: Extract & Calculate**

1. Locate exact values
2. Apply the formula
3. Verify the answer makes sense

---

## 4. Essential Formulas and Concepts

### **Percentage Calculations:**

$$\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \times 100$$

$$\text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100$$

$$\text{Percentage Point Change} = \text{New \%} - \text{Old \%}$$

**Key Distinction:**
- "Increased by 50%" means New = Old × 1.5
- "Increased to 50%" means New = 50 (or 50% of some reference)

### **Ratio and Proportion:**

$$\text{Ratio } a:b = \frac{a}{b}$$

If A:B = 3:4, then A = 3k and B = 4k for some k.

### **Average:**

$$\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}$$

### **Compound Growth:**

$$\text{Final} = \text{Initial} \times (1 + r)^n$$

Where r = rate per period, n = number of periods.

### **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**

$$CAGR = \left(\frac{\text{Final}}{\text{Initial}}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1$$

---

## 5. Table Interpretation

### **Reading Tables:**

1. **Header analysis:** What does each column/row represent?
2. **Unit check:** Are values in lakhs, crores, thousands?
3. **Missing data:** Are there blanks or footnotes?

### **Common Question Types:**

**Type 1: Direct Reading**
"What was the sales in 2021?" → Read directly from table.

**Type 2: Arithmetic Operations**
"What is the total sales from 2020 to 2022?" → Sum values.

**Type 3: Percentage Calculations**
"What was the percentage increase in sales from 2020 to 2021?"
$$= \frac{180 - 150}{150} \times 100 = 20\%$$

**Type 4: Ratio Questions**
"What is the ratio of profit to sales in 2022?"
$$= \frac{40}{210} = \frac{4}{21}$$

**Type 5: Average Questions**
"What is the average number of employees over the 3 years?"
$$= \frac{500 + 550 + 600}{3} = 550$$

### **Example Table Problem:**

**Data:**
| Product | Q1 Sales | Q2 Sales | Q3 Sales | Q4 Sales |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| A | 120 | 150 | 180 | 200 |
| B | 80 | 90 | 100 | 130 |
| C | 200 | 180 | 220 | 240 |

**Q1:** Which product showed the highest growth rate from Q1 to Q4?

**Solution:**
- A: (200-120)/120 × 100 = 66.67%
- B: (130-80)/80 × 100 = 62.5%
- C: (240-200)/200 × 100 = 20%

**Answer:** Product A

**Q2:** What is the total sales of all products in Q2?

**Solution:** 150 + 90 + 180 = 420

---

## 6. Bar Graph Interpretation

### **Reading Bar Graphs:**

1. **X-axis:** Categories or time periods
2. **Y-axis:** Quantity/value (check scale!)
3. **Bar height:** Represents the value

### **Types of Bar Graphs:**

**Simple Bar Graph:** One bar per category
```
    |████████ 80
    |██████ 60
    |████ 40
    +--------→
      A  B  C
```

**Grouped Bar Graph:** Multiple bars per category (for comparison)
```
    |███ ▓▓▓ 
    |███ ▓▓▓ ▓▓ 
    +--------→
      2020   2021
    ███ = Product X, ▓▓▓ = Product Y
```

**Stacked Bar Graph:** Bars stacked on top of each other
```
    |▓▓▓|███
    |▓▓|████
    +--------→
      A    B
    Lower part + Upper part = Total
```

### **Common Traps:**

1. **Scale starts at non-zero:** Bar appears shorter/taller than actual ratio
2. **Different scales for different bars:** Comparison becomes misleading
3. **Approximate readings:** Read carefully, especially mid-points

### **Example Bar Graph Problem:**

**Data (Stacked Bar):**
Company revenue split between Domestic (D) and Export (E)

| Year | Domestic | Export | Total |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 2020 | 100 | 50 | 150 |
| 2021 | 120 | 80 | 200 |
| 2022 | 150 | 100 | 250 |

**Q:** What percentage of 2022 revenue came from exports?
$$= \frac{100}{250} \times 100 = 40\%$$

**Q:** What was the CAGR of total revenue from 2020 to 2022?
$$= \left(\frac{250}{150}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - 1 = \left(1.667\right)^{0.5} - 1 = 1.291 - 1 = 29.1\%$$

---

## 7. Line Graph Interpretation

### **Reading Line Graphs:**

1. **X-axis:** Usually time
2. **Y-axis:** Value/quantity
3. **Slope:** Indicates rate of change
   - Steep upward = fast increase
   - Flat = stable
   - Downward = decrease

### **Key Observations:**

**Trend:** Overall direction (increasing, decreasing, stable)
**Peaks and Troughs:** Maximum and minimum points
**Rate of Change:** Steepness of line
**Crossover Points:** When two lines intersect

### **Example Line Graph Analysis:**

**Scenario:** Sales of Products X and Y over 5 years

| Year | Product X | Product Y |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 2018 | 100 | 80 |
| 2019 | 120 | 100 |
| 2020 | 140 | 130 |
| 2021 | 150 | 160 |
| 2022 | 160 | 200 |

**Observations:**
1. Both products show upward trend
2. Product Y grows faster than X (steeper slope)
3. Lines cross between 2020 and 2021 (Y overtakes X)
4. By 2022, Y leads by 40 units

**Q:** In which year did Product Y first exceed Product X?
**Answer:** 2021

**Q:** What is the average annual growth of Product X?
$$= \frac{160 - 100}{4} = 15 \text{ units/year}$$

Or as percentage: $\left(\frac{160}{100}\right)^{0.25} - 1 = 12.47\%$ CAGR

---

## 8. Pie Chart Interpretation

### **Reading Pie Charts:**

1. **Total = 100%** or specific value mentioned
2. **Sector angle:** Proportional to percentage (3.6° = 1%)
3. **Comparison:** Based on sector size

### **Angle-Percentage Relationship:**

$$\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Angle}}{360} \times 100$$

$$\text{Angle} = \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \times 360$$

### **Common Calculations:**

**From percentage to value:**
$$\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \times \text{Total}$$

**From value to percentage:**
$$\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Value}}{\text{Total}} \times 100$$

### **Example Pie Chart Problem:**

**Data:** Monthly expenses of a family (Total = ₹60,000)

| Category | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| Rent | 30% |
| Food | 25% |
| Transport | 15% |
| Education | 20% |
| Savings | 10% |

**Q:** What is the amount spent on Food?
$$= 0.25 \times 60,000 = ₹15,000$$

**Q:** If Rent increases by 20%, what is the new rent amount?
$$= 30\% \times 60,000 \times 1.2 = 18,000 \times 1.2 = ₹21,600$$

**Q:** What is the angle of the Education sector?
$$= 20\% \times 360 = 72°$$

**Q:** What is the ratio of Transport to Savings?
$$= 15:10 = 3:2$$

## 9. Caselet/Passage-Based DI

### **Approach:**

1. **Read the entire passage once** — understand the context
2. **Identify key data points** — note numbers and relationships
3. **Create a mini-table** — organize extracted data
4. **Answer questions** — refer to your organized data

### **Example Caselet:**

*"A company had 200 employees in 2020. The workforce increased by 25% in 2021 and then decreased by 10% in 2022. The average salary in 2020 was ₹50,000, which increased by 10% each year. 40% of employees are in the technical team, and the rest are in non-technical roles."*

**Extracted Data:**

| Year | Employees | Avg Salary |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 2020 | 200 | 50,000 |
| 2021 | 200 × 1.25 = 250 | 55,000 |
| 2022 | 250 × 0.9 = 225 | 60,500 |

Technical: 40%, Non-technical: 60%

**Q:** What is the total salary expense in 2022?
$$= 225 \times 60,500 = ₹1,36,12,500$$

**Q:** How many technical employees were there in 2021?
$$= 250 \times 0.4 = 100$$

## 10. Speed Tricks for DI

### **Trick 1: Approximation**

For competitive exams, approximate when exact calculation is time-consuming.

**Example:** 247 × 53 ≈ 250 × 50 = 12,500

### **Trick 2: Percentage Shortcuts**

| Percentage | Quick Calculation |
|------------|-------------------|
| 10% | Divide by 10 |
| 5% | Half of 10% |
| 1% | Divide by 100 |
| 25% | Divide by 4 |
| 33.33% | Divide by 3 |
| 12.5% | Divide by 8 |

**Example:** 25% of 840 = 840/4 = 210

### **Trick 3: Comparison Without Calculation**

When comparing ratios or percentages:
- Cross-multiply to compare fractions
- Look at trends rather than exact values

**Example:** Compare 3/7 and 5/12
- 3 × 12 = 36
- 5 × 7 = 35
- 36 > 35, so 3/7 > 5/12

### **Trick 4: The "Rule of 72"**

To estimate doubling time with compound growth:
$$\text{Doubling Time} \approx \frac{72}{\text{Growth Rate \%}}$$

**Example:** At 12% growth, money doubles in 72/12 = 6 years

### **Trick 5: Successive Percentage Change**

For two successive changes of a% and b%:
$$\text{Net Change} = a + b + \frac{ab}{100}$$

**Example:** Increase 20%, then decrease 10%:
$$= 20 - 10 + \frac{20 \times (-10)}{100} = 10 - 2 = 8\%$$ increase

## 11. Common DI Question Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Maximum/Minimum**

"Which year had the highest sales?"
→ Quick scan and compare values

### **Pattern 2: Ranking**

"Rank the products in decreasing order of profit"
→ List and order values

### **Pattern 3: Percentage Change**

"What was the percentage increase from X to Y?"
→ Apply formula: (Y-X)/X × 100

### **Pattern 4: Ratio Questions**

"What is the ratio of A to B?"
→ Express as A:B in simplest form

### **Pattern 5: Average/Total**

"What is the average value?"
→ Sum all values, divide by count

### **Pattern 6: Contribution/Share**

"What percentage does X contribute to total?"
→ X/Total × 100

### **Pattern 7: Trend Questions**

"In how many years did sales increase?"
→ Count years where current > previous

### **Pattern 8: Comparison Questions**

"By what factor did sales increase from 2020 to 2022?"
→ Sales_2022 / Sales_2020

## 12. Edge Cases and Examiner Traps

### **Trap 1: Unit Confusion**

Values in lakhs vs. crores, or thousands vs. millions. Always check units!

### **Trap 2: Scale Mismatch**

Different axes may have different scales. Don't visually compare without checking.

### **Trap 3: Percentage vs. Percentage Points**

- "Profit margin increased from 10% to 15%" = 5 percentage points increase
- But as a percentage: (15-10)/10 × 100 = 50% increase

### **Trap 4: Base Year Confusion**

"Compared to base year" — identify what the base is.

### **Trap 5: Stacked Chart Misreading**

In stacked charts, individual segment values are the height of that segment, not the total height!

### **Trap 6: Approximate Readings**

Bar/line graphs may require reading approximate values. Read carefully, especially at mid-points.

## 13. Solved Examples

### **Example 1: Table-Based**

**Data:**
| Branch | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| A | 45 | 52 | 60 |
| B | 30 | 38 | 42 |
| C | 55 | 48 | 55 |

**Q:** Which branch showed consistent growth?

**Analysis:**
- A: 45 → 52 → 60 (consistent increase) ✓
- B: 30 → 38 → 42 (consistent increase) ✓
- C: 55 → 48 → 55 (decrease then increase) ✗

**Answer:** Branches A and B

**Q:** What is the percentage contribution of Branch C to total in 2022?
$$\text{Total} = 60 + 42 + 55 = 157$$
$$\text{C's share} = \frac{55}{157} \times 100 = 35.03\%$$

### **Example 2: Multiple Charts**

**Given:**
- Pie chart: Market share of 4 companies (A=35%, B=25%, C=20%, D=20%)
- Total market size: ₹500 crores

**Q:** What is Company A's revenue?
$$= 35\% \times 500 = ₹175 \text{ crores}$$

**Q:** If A's market share increases to 40% next year (total market unchanged), what is the new revenue?
$$= 40\% \times 500 = ₹200 \text{ crores}$$

**Q:** By what percentage did A's revenue increase?
$$= \frac{200 - 175}{175} \times 100 = 14.29\%$$

### **Example 3: Caselet**

*"A survey found that 60% of 500 respondents prefer Brand X, and the rest prefer Brand Y. Among Brand X fans, 40% are males. Among Brand Y fans, 55% are females."*

**Extracted:**
- Brand X fans: 60% of 500 = 300
- Brand Y fans: 40% of 500 = 200
- Males preferring X: 40% of 300 = 120
- Females preferring X: 60% of 300 = 180
- Females preferring Y: 55% of 200 = 110
- Males preferring Y: 45% of 200 = 90

**Q:** What percentage of all respondents are females?
$$= \frac{180 + 110}{500} \times 100 = \frac{290}{500} \times 100 = 58\%$$

**Q:** What is the ratio of males preferring X to males preferring Y?
$$= 120:90 = 4:3$$

## 16. Answer Key

**Q1:** 
- P: 25/100 = 0.25
- Q: 40/120 = 0.33
- R: 35/140 = 0.25
- S: 30/80 = 0.375

**Answer:** City S has highest density

**Q2:** (25+40+35+30)/4 = 130/4 = **32.5 lakhs**

**Q3:** 
- 2018: 100 < 120 ✗
- 2019: 120 < 130 ✗
- 2020: 140 > 125 ✓
- 2021: 160 > 150 ✓
- 2022: 180 = 180 ✗

**Answer:** 2020 and 2021

**Q4:** CAGR = (180/100)^(1/4) - 1 = 1.8^0.25 - 1 = 1.158 - 1 = **15.8%**

**Q5:** 
Current Salaries = 45% of 2L = 90,000
New Salaries = 90,000 × 1.1 = 99,000
New Total = 2L - 90,000 + 99,000 = 2,09,000
New Salary % = 99,000/2,09,000 × 100 = **47.37%**

**Q6:** 20%:8% = **5:2**
