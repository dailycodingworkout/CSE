## 🧠 Universal Exam Strategies

### **Before the Exam**
1. ✅ Memorize all Quick Tricks
2. ✅ Practice the 5-Second Snap-Checks
3. ✅ Know the common Examiner Traps
4. ✅ Have mental models ready (sliders, visualizations)

### **During the Exam**
1. **Scan first:** Quickly assess difficulty of each question
2. **Low-hanging fruit:** Solve easy questions first
3. **Time box:** Don't spend more than 2 minutes on reasoning questions
4. **Eliminate:** In MCQs, eliminate wrong options first
5. **Guess smartly:** When unsure, use logical elimination

### **Question Type Strategies**

| Question Type | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| Direct calculation | Apply formula immediately |
| Multi-step reasoning | Draw diagrams/tables |
| Possibility-based | Check minimum required conditions |
| Comparison | Use ratios, avoid absolute calculations |
| Data-heavy | Approximate when exact calculation is slow |

## 🔢 Master Formulas Quick Reference

### Clocks
$$\theta = |30H - 5.5M|$$

### Calendars (Odd Days)
- Ordinary year: 1 odd day
- Leap year: 2 odd days
- Century: 0 (400 yrs), 5 (100 yrs), 3 (200 yrs), 1 (300 yrs)

### Percentage Change
$$\% \text{ Change} = \frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100$$

### Data Sufficiency Decision
1. Check Statement I alone
2. Check Statement II alone (forget I!)
3. Combine only if neither works alone

### Syllogisms
- All → Some (valid)
- Some → All (invalid)
- No ↔ No (convertible)
