## 🎯 Why Aptitude Matters

| Exam | Aptitude Weightage | Typical Questions |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| GATE | 15 marks (15% of total) | 10 questions (5×1 + 5×2 marks) |
| ESE Prelims | ~50 marks | Engineering Aptitude Section |
| ESE Mains | Varies | Technical + Aptitude blend |

> **Pro Tip:** Aptitude is often the **difference maker** between Rank 100 and Rank 10. These marks come with 100% accuracy if you master the fundamentals.

## 🚀 Study Strategy for Rank #1

### The 3-Phase Mastery Approach

```
Phase 1: FOUNDATION (Week 1-2)
├── Master Number System completely
├── Build mental math speed
└── Understand "WHY" behind every formula

Phase 2: INTEGRATION (Week 3-4)
├── Connect topics (Percentages → P&L → SI/CI)
├── Practice mixed problems
└── Develop shortcut intuition

Phase 3: EXAMINATION (Week 5+)
├── Solve previous year GATE/ESE questions
├── Time-bound practice (2 min/question max)
└── Focus on NAT precision and MSQ elimination
```

### ⚡ Speed Optimization Rules

| Technique | Application | Time Saved |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Fraction-to-Percent Memory** | 1/8 = 12.5%, 1/12 = 8.33% | 15-20 sec/question |
| **Successive Percentage** | Multiple changes | 10-15 sec/question |
| **Alligation Method** | Mixtures, averages | 20-30 sec/question |
| **Component Analysis** | Ratio problems | 15-20 sec/question |
| **Vedic Math Squares** | (a±b)² type | 10 sec/question |

## 📋 Quick Reference Formulas

### Essential Percentage Conversions
| Fraction | Percentage | Fraction | Percentage |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 1/2 | 50% | 1/6 | 16.67% |
| 1/3 | 33.33% | 1/7 | 14.28% |
| 1/4 | 25% | 1/8 | 12.5% |
| 1/5 | 20% | 1/9 | 11.11% |

### Key Speed-Distance-Time Relations
$$\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}, \quad \text{Average Speed} = \frac{2S_1 \cdot S_2}{S_1 + S_2}$$

### Work Efficiency
$$\text{If A does work in } x \text{ days, A's 1-day work} = \frac{1}{x}$$

### Compound Interest
$$A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n$$
