# Chapter 9: Exam-Specific Strategies

## The Atomic Truth
> **Strategy = Optimizing limited time for maximum marks.**

## 9.1 Understanding the Exam Landscape

### Spatial Aptitude Across Exams

| Exam | Section | Questions | Marks | Time/Question |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **GATE** | General Aptitude | 2-4 | 4-8 | 1.5-2 min |
| **ESE (Prelims)** | Paper I | 5-8 | 10-16 | 1-1.5 min |
| **PSU** | Aptitude | 5-10 | Varies | 1-1.5 min |
| **BANK PO** | Reasoning | 5-10 | 5-10 | 45-60 sec |

### The Strategic Implication

```
GATE: Quality over quantity
      → Take time, get it right
      → Negative marking = -1/3 for 1-mark, -2/3 for 2-mark

ESE: Speed with accuracy
     → More questions, less time
     → Negative = 1/3 of allotted marks

PSU: Similar to GATE
     → Company-specific patterns
     → Research past papers

BANK: Speed is CRITICAL
      → Maximum questions in minimum time
      → Skip lengthy problems, return later
```

## 9.2 GATE Spatial Aptitude Strategy

### The GATE GA Structure

```
General Aptitude (15 marks):
├── 5 questions × 1 mark = 5 marks
└── 5 questions × 2 marks = 10 marks

Spatial questions: Usually 2-4 questions
Typical marks: 4-8 marks
```

### GATE Spatial Topics by Frequency

| Topic | Frequency | Typical Marks |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 3D Cubes/Dice | High | 2 marks |
| Paper Folding | High | 2 marks |
| 2D Rotation | Medium | 1-2 marks |
| Pattern Completion | Medium | 1 mark |
| Direction Sense | Low-Medium | 1-2 marks |

### GATE Time Allocation Strategy

```
For 2-mark question (target: 2 minutes max):
├── 30 sec: Understand problem
├── 60 sec: Apply technique
├── 20 sec: Verify answer
└── 10 sec: Mark and move on

Total: ~2 minutes per 2-mark question
```

### ⚡ GATE Quick Wins

1. **Dice problems**: Use 7-minus rule (10 seconds)
2. **Mirror images**: Quick chirality check (15 seconds)
3. **Simple patterns**: Identify rule in 1-2 rows (30 seconds)

### 🔴 GATE Traps to Avoid

1. **Over-analysis**: Don't second-guess obvious answers
2. **Time sink**: Skip if > 3 minutes spent, return later
3. **Calculation errors**: Write down coordinates, don't do mentally for complex paths

### GATE Decision Framework

```
Read question (10 sec)
     │
     ├── Recognize type? ──YES──→ Apply technique
     │                            │
     │                            ├── Answer confident? ──YES──→ Mark & move
     │                            │
     │                            └── Uncertain? ──→ Eliminate options
     │                                               │
     │                                               └── Still unsure? ──→ Mark best guess
     │
     └── Don't recognize? ──→ Read again carefully
                              │
                              ├── Now clear? ──→ Apply technique
                              │
                              └── Still unclear? ──→ Skip, return later
```

## 9.3 ESE Prelims Spatial Strategy

### ESE Paper I Structure

```
Total questions: 120 (2 hours)
Marks per question: 2
Negative marking: 0.67 marks

Spatial/Reasoning: Approximately 10-15 questions
Target: 8-12 correct
```

### ESE Spatial Topics by Frequency

| Topic | Frequency | Difficulty |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Embedded Figures | Very High | Medium |
| Cubes/3D | High | Medium-High |
| Pattern Series | High | Low-Medium |
| Paper Folding | Medium | Medium |
| Mirror/Water Images | Medium | Low |
| Figure Counting | Medium | Medium-High |

### ESE Time Allocation Strategy

```
Target: 60-75 seconds per spatial question

For standard question:
├── 10 sec: Read and classify
├── 30-40 sec: Solve
├── 10-15 sec: Verify
└── 5 sec: Mark

For complex question:
├── If > 90 seconds likely → Skip
├── Return during final 20 minutes
└── Make educated guess if time runs out
```

### ⚡ ESE Quick Wins

1. **Embedded figures**: Anchor point method (fast elimination)
2. **Pattern series**: Check last 2 figures for rule confirmation
3. **Simple 2D**: Mirror = flip, Water = flip upside down

### ESE Section Strategy

```
First pass (45-50 min for spatial/reasoning):
├── Solve all LOW difficulty
├── Solve all MEDIUM if time permits
└── Mark uncertain answers

Second pass (remaining time):
├── Attempt skipped MEDIUM questions
├── Review marked uncertain answers
└── Skip remaining HIGH difficulty unless confident
```

---

## 9.4 PSU Exam Spatial Strategy

### PSU Aptitude Overview

```
Major PSUs with Spatial Questions:
├── IOCL: Heavy reasoning focus
├── ONGC: Mixed aptitude
├── BHEL: Technical + aptitude
├── NTPC: Balanced sections
├── GAIL: Aptitude important
└── HPCL: Similar to IOCL
```

### Company-Specific Patterns

| Company | Spatial Focus | Difficulty | Time Pressure |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| IOCL | High | Medium | High |
| ONGC | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| BHEL | High | Medium-High | Medium |
| NTPC | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| HPCL | High | Medium | High |
| GAIL | Medium | Low-Medium | Low |

### PSU Preparation Strategy

```
Step 1: Get past papers (5 years if possible)
Step 2: Identify company-specific patterns
Step 3: Practice those specific types
Step 4: Time yourself under exam conditions
```

### ⚡ PSU Quick Tips

1. **Most PSUs follow GATE pattern**: If you're prepared for GATE, you're largely prepared for PSU
2. **Online tests**: Many PSUs use computer-based tests, practice on screen
3. **Negative marking varies**: Check specific exam rules

---

## 9.5 BANK Exam Spatial Strategy

### Bank Reasoning Section

```
Typical Structure:
├── Total questions: 35-40 reasoning
├── Time: ~25-30 minutes
├── Spatial questions: 5-10
├── Time per spatial question: 30-45 seconds
```

### Bank Exam Spatial Topics

| Topic | Frequency | Difficulty |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Mirror Images | Very High | Low |
| Paper Folding | High | Low-Medium |
| Figure Series | High | Low |
| Counting Figures | Medium | Medium |
| Embedded Figures | Medium | Low-Medium |
| Cubes | Low | Medium |

### Bank Exam Speed Techniques

```
Priority Order:
1. Mirror/Water Images (fastest)
2. Simple Series
3. Paper Folding (2 folds max)
4. Embedded Figures
5. Skip counting if complex
```

### ⚡ Bank Exam Quick Wins

1. **Mirror images**: Identify asymmetric part only (5-10 seconds)
2. **Series**: Check last two figures (pattern confirmation)
3. **Paper folding**: Count layers = 2^(folds), holes = layers

### 🔴 Bank Exam Time Traps

1. **Complex counting problems**: Skip initially
2. **Unusual figure types**: Move on if not immediately clear
3. **Multi-step problems**: Calculate time vs marks trade-off

## 9.7 The 80-20 Rule Applied

### Maximum Return on Study Time

```
20% of topics → 80% of questions

For GATE: 3D + Paper Folding + 2D Rotation
For ESE: Embedded + Series + Cubes
For PSU: Similar to GATE
For BANK: Mirror + Series + Paper Folding
```

### Minimum Viable Preparation

| Exam | Minimum Topics to Cover | Expected Score |
|------|-------------------------|----------------|
| GATE | 3D, Paper Folding, 2D | 60-70% of spatial marks |
| ESE | Embedded, Series, 3D | 50-60% of spatial marks |
| PSU | Same as GATE | 60-70% |
| BANK | Mirror, Series, Simple Folding | 70-80% |

### Time Investment Recommendation

```
Total Spatial Prep Time: 20-30 hours

Distribution:
├── 2D Basics (Mirror, Rotation): 4 hours
├── 3D Visualization: 6 hours
├── Paper Folding: 4 hours
├── Pattern/Series: 4 hours
├── Embedded/Counting: 3 hours
├── Direction Sense: 3 hours

├── Mark the question
├── Move to next
├── Return later if time allows
└── Don't let one question consume disproportionate time
```

## 9.11 Last-Minute Revision

### One-Page Formula Sheet

```
DICE:
- Opposite sum = 7 (standard die)
- 7 - visible = opposite

PAPER FOLDING:
- n folds = 2^n layers
- Holes = layers × punches (unless on fold)

PYTHAGOREAN TRIPLES:
- 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, 7-24-25

DIRECTIONS:
- Facing N: Left=W, Right=E
- Facing E: Left=N, Right=S
- Facing S: Left=E, Right=W
- Facing W: Left=S, Right=N

ROTATIONS:
- 90° CW: Top→Right→Bottom→Left→Top
- Mirror + Mirror = 180° rotation

CUBE PAINTED:
- Corners (3 faces): 8
- Edges (2 faces): 12(n-2)
- Faces (1 face): 6(n-2)²
- Interior (0 faces): (n-2)³

EULER:
- V - E + F = 2
```

### Mental Checklist Before Each Question

```
1. What TYPE is this? (2D, 3D, Direction, etc.)
2. What TECHNIQUE applies?
3. What's the TRAP to avoid?
4. SOLVE and VERIFY
```
