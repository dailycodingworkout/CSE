## 1. Analogies

### The Singularity
> **Analogies test the ability to identify relationships between word pairs.**

### The Root Architecture

An analogy follows the structure:
$$A : B :: C : D$$

Where the relationship between $A$ and $B$ is identical to the relationship between $C$ and $D$.

### 🔑 The 15 Master Relationship Types

| # | Relationship Type | Example | Pattern |
|---|------------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Synonym** | Happy : Joyful :: Sad : Melancholy | Same meaning |
| 2 | **Antonym** | Hot : Cold :: Light : Dark | Opposite meaning |
| 3 | **Part : Whole** | Wheel : Car :: Key : Keyboard | Component of |
| 4 | **Whole : Part** | Tree : Branch :: Book : Chapter | Contains |
| 5 | **Cause : Effect** | Rain : Flood :: Drought : Famine | Leads to |
| 6 | **Object : Function** | Knife : Cut :: Pen : Write | Used for |
| 7 | **Object : Material** | Chair : Wood :: Ring : Gold | Made of |
| 8 | **Worker : Tool** | Carpenter : Hammer :: Surgeon : Scalpel | Uses |
| 9 | **Worker : Workplace** | Doctor : Hospital :: Teacher : School | Works at |
| 10 | **Degree/Intensity** | Warm : Hot :: Cool : Cold | Intensity scale |
| 11 | **Male : Female** | Bull : Cow :: Lion : Lioness | Gender pair |
| 12 | **Young : Adult** | Puppy : Dog :: Kitten : Cat | Age progression |
| 13 | **Product : Raw Material** | Bread : Wheat :: Wine : Grapes | Made from |
| 14 | **Symbol : Represented** | Dove : Peace :: Red : Danger | Symbolizes |
| 15 | **Category : Member** | Fruit : Apple :: Vehicle : Car | Type of |

### 🎯 The GATE Pattern Recognition Algorithm

```
Step 1: Identify the relationship in the given pair (A:B)
Step 2: Frame it as a sentence: "A is the ___ of B" or "A ___ B"
Step 3: Apply the same sentence to (C:?)
Step 4: Select the option that maintains the EXACT relationship
```

### 🛠️ Detailed Solving Techniques for Analogies

#### Technique 1: The Sentence Bridge Method
**How to use:** Create a simple sentence linking the first pair, then apply it to find the answer.

**Example:**
```
Question: Painter : Brush :: Writer : ?
Step 1: Create sentence → "A Painter USES a Brush"
Step 2: Apply to second pair → "A Writer USES a ___"
Step 3: Answer → Pen ✓
```

#### Technique 2: The Relationship Classification First
**How to use:** Before looking at options, classify the relationship type from the 15 master types.

**Example:**
```
Question: Cub : Lion :: Calf : ?
Step 1: Identify → Cub is the YOUNG of Lion (Young : Adult relationship)
Step 2: Apply → Calf is the YOUNG of ___
Step 3: Answer → Cow ✓
```

#### Technique 3: The Option Testing Method
**How to use:** When unsure, test each option systematically.

**Example:**
```
Question: Doctor : Stethoscope :: Carpenter : ?
Options: (A) Wood  (B) Furniture  (C) Hammer  (D) House

Test each:
(A) Doctor uses Stethoscope → Carpenter uses Wood? (Wood is material, not tool) ✗
(B) Doctor uses Stethoscope → Carpenter uses Furniture? (Furniture is product) ✗
(C) Doctor uses Stethoscope → Carpenter uses Hammer? (Both are tools) ✓
(D) Doctor uses Stethoscope → Carpenter uses House? (House is workplace/product) ✗

Answer: (C) Hammer
```

#### Technique 4: The Elimination by Relationship Type
**How to use:** Eliminate options that create a different relationship type.

```
Question: Pen : Poet :: Brush : ?
Options: (A) Canvas  (B) Painter  (C) Art  (D) Color

Relationship in first pair: Tool : User
Eliminate non-matching:
(A) Brush : Canvas = Tool : Surface ✗
(B) Brush : Painter = Tool : User ✓
(C) Brush : Art = Tool : Product ✗
(D) Brush : Color = Tool : Material ✗

Answer: (B) Painter
```

### ⚠️ The Genius Trap (Adversarial Analysis)

**Trap Type 1: Order Inversion**
```
Question: Doctor : Hospital :: ?
Wrong thinking: Hospital : Doctor (inverting the order)
Right answer: Teacher : School (maintaining the relationship direction)
```

**Trap Type 2: Multiple Valid Relationships**
```
Question: Pen : Write :: Knife : ?
Trap option: Sharp (describes knife but wrong relationship)
Correct option: Cut (function relationship maintained)
```

**Trap Type 3: Partial Relationship Match**
```
Question: Lion : Roar :: Dog : ?
Trap option: Pet (relationship exists but different type)
Correct option: Bark (sound relationship maintained)
```

## 2. Classification (Odd One Out)

### The Singularity
> **"Find the element that breaks the hidden pattern."**

### The Root Architecture

In classification problems, you're given a set of items where all except one share a common property.

$$\text{If } \{A, B, C, D\} \text{ and } A, B, C \in \text{Pattern } P, \text{ then } D = \text{Odd One Out}$$

### 🔑 The 10 Common Classification Bases

| # | Classification Type | Example Set | Odd One | Reason |
|---|-------------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Even vs Odd** | 2, 4, 7, 8 | 7 | Odd number |
| 2 | **Prime vs Composite** | 3, 5, 9, 11 | 9 | Composite number |
| 3 | **Category Membership** | Rose, Lily, Oak, Jasmine | Oak | Not a flower |
| 4 | **Alphabetical Position** | B, D, F, G | G | Not +2 pattern |
| 5 | **Vowel/Consonant** | A, E, B, I | B | Consonant |
| 6 | **Number Pattern** | 4, 9, 16, 25, 30 | 30 | Not a perfect square |
| 7 | **Gender Based** | King, Queen, Prince, Duke | Duke | Not royalty role |
| 8 | **Geographical** | India, China, London, Japan | London | City, not country |
| 9 | **Profession** | Doctor, Engineer, Hospital, Lawyer | Hospital | Not a profession |
| 10 | **Action/State** | Run, Walk, Sleep, Jump | Sleep | Not locomotion |

---

### 🎯 The Classification Algorithm

```
Step 1: Find what 3 items have in common (the "majority rule")
Step 2: Verify the 4th item violates this commonality
Step 3: Check for deeper patterns (the examiner might use a subtler classification)
Step 4: If two patterns exist, choose the more specific one
```

### ⚠️ The Genius Trap

**Trap: Superficial vs Deep Classification**
```
Set: Apple, Banana, Carrot, Mango

Superficial thinking: All are food → Carrot is different (vegetable vs fruit)
But examiner might want: All have 5+ letters → Apple is odd (5 letters exactly)

Resolution: GATE typically uses the more OBVIOUS classification.
           ESE might use subtle patterns.
```

## 3. Series Completion

### The Singularity
> **"Every series is a pattern in disguise; find the generator function."**

### The Root Architecture

A series follows a rule $f(n)$ that generates the next term:
$$a_{n+1} = f(a_n) \text{ or } a_n = g(n)$$

### 🔑 The 12 Series Pattern Types

#### Type 1: Arithmetic Progression (AP)
$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$
**Example:** 3, 7, 11, 15, **19** (common difference $d = 4$)

#### Type 2: Geometric Progression (GP)
$$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$$
**Example:** 2, 6, 18, 54, **162** (common ratio $r = 3$)

#### Type 3: Fibonacci-like
$$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$$
**Example:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, **8**

#### Type 4: Square Series
$$a_n = n^2 \text{ or variations}$$
**Example:** 1, 4, 9, 16, **25**

#### Type 5: Cube Series
$$a_n = n^3$$
**Example:** 1, 8, 27, 64, **125**

#### Type 6: Difference of Differences
$$\text{First difference: } d_1, d_2, d_3...$$
$$\text{Second difference: } d_1' = d_2 - d_1...$$
**Example:** 2, 5, 10, 17, **26** 
- Differences: 3, 5, 7, **9** (AP with $d=2$)

#### Type 7: Alternating Series
$$a_n = \begin{cases} f(n) & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\ g(n) & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \end{cases}$$
**Example:** 2, 5, 4, 10, 6, **15** (two interlaced series)

#### Type 8: Prime Number Series
**Example:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, **13**

#### Type 9: Factorial-based
$$a_n = n!$$
**Example:** 1, 2, 6, 24, **120**

#### Type 10: Mixed Operations
$$a_n = a_{n-1} \times k_1 + k_2$$
**Example:** 1, 3, 7, 15, **31** ($a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 1$)

#### Type 11: Letter Series (Alphabetical Position)
**Example:** B, D, F, H, **J** (every second letter)
Position: 2, 4, 6, 8, **10**

#### Type 12: Alphanumeric Mixed
**Example:** A1, C3, E5, G7, **I9**

### 🎯 The Series Cracking Algorithm

```
Step 1: Calculate differences between consecutive terms
Step 2: If differences are constant → AP
Step 3: If differences form a pattern → Apply recursively
Step 4: Calculate ratios → If constant, it's GP
Step 5: Check for squares, cubes, primes, factorials
Step 6: Look for alternating patterns (split into two series)
Step 7: Check for position-based formulas
```

---

### 📊 The Difference Table Method

For complex series, build a difference table:

**Example:** 1, 2, 6, 15, 31, ?

| Level | Sequence |
|-------|----------|
| Original | 1, 2, 6, 15, 31, ? |
| 1st Diff | 1, 4, 9, 16, ? |
| 2nd Diff | 3, 5, 7, ? |
| 3rd Diff | 2, 2, 2 |

Working back:
- 3rd diff constant = 2
- Next 2nd diff = 7 + 2 = 9
- Next 1st diff = 16 + 9 = 25
- Next term = 31 + 25 = **56**

---

### ⚠️ The Genius Trap

**Trap: Multiple Valid Patterns**
```
Series: 2, 4, 8, ?

Pattern 1: GP with r=2 → Next term = 16
Pattern 2: Adding 2, 4, 6... → Next term = 14

GATE Rule: The SIMPLER pattern (GP here) is usually correct.
```

---

### 📝 Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** (GATE 2020 Pattern)
```
Find the next term: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ?
```

**Solution:**
- Differences: 3, 5, 7, 9 (AP with d=2)
- Next difference: 11
- Answer: 27 + 11 = **38**

**Problem 2:** (GATE NAT)
```
Find the next term: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ?
```

**Solution:**
- Fibonacci series: $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$
- Answer: 8 + 13 = **21**

**Problem 3:** (ESE Pattern)
```
Find the missing term: 2, 6, 12, 20, ?, 42
```

**Solution:**
- Pattern: $n(n+1)$ where $n$ = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- $1×2=2$, $2×3=6$, $3×4=12$, $4×5=20$, $5×6=?$, $6×7=42$
- Answer: **30**
