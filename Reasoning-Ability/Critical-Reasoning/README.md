## 1. Arguments & Structure

### The Singularity
> **"Every argument is: Evidence + Assumption → Conclusion."**

### The Root Architecture

An argument consists of:
$$\text{Premises} + \text{Hidden Assumptions} \rightarrow \text{Conclusion}$$

---

### 🔑 Argument Components

| Component | Definition | Signal Words |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **Premise** | Facts or evidence given | Because, Since, Given that, As |
| **Conclusion** | The claim being made | Therefore, Thus, Hence, So, Consequently |
| **Assumption** | Unstated bridge between premise and conclusion | (Hidden - must be identified) |

---

### 🎯 The Argument Analysis Algorithm

```
Step 1: IDENTIFY the conclusion (what's being claimed?)
Step 2: IDENTIFY the premises (what evidence supports it?)
Step 3: FIND the gap (what's assumed but not stated?)
Step 4: EVALUATE the logic (does conclusion follow from premises?)
Step 5: ANSWER the specific question type
```

---

### 📝 Argument Mapping Example

**Argument:**
> "Sales of electric vehicles have increased by 50% this year. Therefore, fossil fuel consumption will decrease significantly in the coming years."

**Mapping:**
- **Premise:** EV sales increased by 50%
- **Conclusion:** Fossil fuel consumption will decrease
- **Hidden Assumption:** EVs replace fossil fuel vehicles (not additive); increase will continue; 50% is significant enough

---

## 2. Assumptions

### The Singularity
> **"An assumption is the invisible pillar. Remove it, and the argument collapses."**

### The Root Architecture

An assumption is:
$$\text{Assumption} = \text{Required Bridge} \text{ from } \text{Premise} \text{ to } \text{Conclusion}$$

---

### 🔑 The Negation Test

To verify if something is an assumption:
1. **Negate** the statement
2. Check if the argument **collapses**
3. If YES → It's an assumption
4. If NO → It's not an assumption

**Example:**
```
Argument: "This restaurant serves organic food, so it must be healthy."

Test Assumption: "Organic food is healthy"
Negation: "Organic food is NOT healthy"

Does argument collapse? YES! Without this, the conclusion doesn't follow.
Therefore, "Organic food is healthy" IS an assumption.
```

---

### 🔑 Types of Assumptions

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Causal Assumption** | X causes Y | "Exercise reduces stress" (assumes causation) |
| **Representativeness** | Sample represents population | "10 users said X, so all will" |
| **No Alternative** | Only the given option exists | "If not A, then definitely B" |
| **Feasibility** | The proposed solution is possible | "We should do X" (assumes X is doable) |
| **Sufficiency** | Given action is enough | "Do X to achieve Y" (X is sufficient) |

---

### ⚠️ The Genius Trap

**Trap 1: Confusing Assumption with Premise**
```
Premise: Stated in the argument
Assumption: NOT stated but required

If it's explicitly mentioned, it's NOT an assumption!
```

**Trap 2: Extreme Assumptions**
```
Arguments usually require MODERATE assumptions, not extreme ones.

Wrong: "ALL electric vehicles are better than ALL fuel vehicles"
Right: "Electric vehicles generally reduce fuel consumption"
```

---

### 📝 Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** (GATE Pattern)
```
Argument: "The company should invest in solar energy because it will 
reduce operating costs in the long run."

Which of the following is an assumption?

(A) The company currently has high operating costs
(B) Solar energy technology will remain affordable
(C) The company cares about environmental impact
(D) Other energy sources are not renewable
```

**Solution:**
Apply negation test:

(A) "Company doesn't have high costs" → Argument still works (reducing any cost is good)
(B) "Solar won't remain affordable" → Argument collapses (won't reduce costs)
(C) "Company doesn't care about environment" → Argument still works (it's about costs)
(D) "Other sources are renewable" → Argument still works (solar still reduces costs)

**Answer:** (B) - Solar energy technology will remain affordable

---

## 3. Strengthening Arguments

### The Singularity
> **"To strengthen, support the assumption or add confirming evidence."**

### The Root Architecture

Strengthening options:
1. **Support the assumption** (prove the hidden bridge)
2. **Add confirming evidence** (more data supporting conclusion)
3. **Eliminate alternatives** (rule out other explanations)

$$\text{Strength} = P(\text{Conclusion} | \text{Premise})$$

Strengthening increases this probability.

---

### 🔑 Types of Strengtheners

| Type | How It Works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Confirm Assumption** | Validates the bridge | "Studies show organic = healthy" |
| **Add Evidence** | More supporting data | "Another survey confirms..." |
| **Rule Out Alternative** | Eliminates competing explanations | "No other factor caused X" |
| **Precedent** | Similar case succeeded | "This worked in company Y" |

---

### 📝 Practice Problem

**Problem:**
```
Argument: "Employee productivity increased after the office was 
redesigned. Therefore, office design affects productivity."

Which STRENGTHENS this argument?

(A) Employees were given raises at the same time
(B) Other offices with similar designs saw no productivity change
(C) No other changes were made during the redesign period
(D) The redesign was expensive
```

**Solution:**
- (A) WEAKENS - raises could explain productivity increase
- (B) WEAKENS - suggests design doesn't cause productivity
- (C) STRENGTHENS - rules out alternative explanations ✓
- (D) IRRELEVANT - cost doesn't affect the causal claim

**Answer:** (C)

---

## 4. Weakening Arguments

### The Singularity
> **"To weaken, attack the assumption or provide counter-evidence."**

### The Root Architecture

Weakening options:
1. **Attack the assumption** (break the bridge)
2. **Provide counter-evidence** (facts contradicting conclusion)
3. **Present alternatives** (other explanations for the evidence)

---

### 🔑 Types of Weakeners

| Type | How It Works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Attack Assumption** | Breaks the bridge | "Organic ≠ always healthy" |
| **Counter-Evidence** | Contradicting data | "Study shows opposite" |
| **Alternative Cause** | Different explanation | "Y caused it, not X" |
| **Implementation Issue** | Practical problems | "This can't work because..." |

---

### ⚠️ The Genius Trap

**Trap 1: Weakening vs Disproving**
```
Weakening: Makes conclusion LESS likely
Disproving: Makes conclusion IMPOSSIBLE

Most arguments can only be weakened, not disproved.
```

**Trap 2: Irrelevant Weakeners**
```
Something negative about the topic is NOT necessarily a weakener.
It must specifically undermine the CONCLUSION.
```

---

### 📝 Practice Problem

**Problem:**
```
Argument: "City X has implemented stricter traffic rules, 
so traffic accidents will decrease."

Which WEAKENS this argument?

(A) City X has poor enforcement of traffic rules
(B) City Y has strict rules and fewer accidents
(C) Traffic accidents cause economic losses
(D) Stricter rules are unpopular among citizens
```

**Solution:**
- (A) WEAKENS - rules won't work if not enforced ✓
- (B) STRENGTHENS - supports the claim
- (C) IRRELEVANT - doesn't affect whether rules reduce accidents
- (D) IRRELEVANT - popularity doesn't affect effectiveness

**Answer:** (A)

---

## 5. Inferences & Conclusions

### The Singularity
> **"An inference is what MUST be true, not what MIGHT be true."**

### The Root Architecture

Types of questions:
1. **Must be True:** Logically follows from premises
2. **Could be True:** Consistent with premises
3. **Cannot be True:** Contradicts premises

$$\text{Valid Inference} \iff \text{Premises} \models \text{Inference}$$

---

### 🔑 The Inference Hierarchy

| Level | Requirement | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Definitely True** | Logically necessary | All A are B; X is A → X is B |
| **Probably True** | Likely but not certain | Most A are B; X is A → X is probably B |
| **Data Insufficient** | Cannot determine | Some A are B; X is A → ? |
| **Probably False** | Unlikely but possible | Few A are B; X is A → X is probably not B |
| **Definitely False** | Logically impossible | No A are B; X is A → X is not B |

---

### 🔑 Inference Checking Strategy

```
Step 1: READ inference carefully
Step 2: FIND support in premises
Step 3: CHECK if inference goes beyond what's stated
Step 4: APPLY appropriate logic:
        - Too strong (all, never, always) → Likely wrong
        - Too weak (some, might, could) → More likely right
Step 5: SELECT inference that DEFINITELY follows
```

---

### ⚠️ The Genius Trap

**Trap 1: Reasonable but Unstated**
```
Something might be TRUE in the real world but NOT follow from the passage.
Only infer what the text SUPPORTS, not what you know.
```

**Trap 2: Extreme Language**
```
Watch for: All, Every, None, Never, Always, Only
These create strong claims that are hard to support.
```

---

### 📝 Practice Problem

**Problem:**
```
Statement: "Most successful entrepreneurs work more than 60 hours 
per week. John is a successful entrepreneur."

Which inference is valid?

(A) John definitely works more than 60 hours per week
(B) John probably works more than 60 hours per week
(C) John works exactly 60 hours per week
(D) Working 60+ hours guarantees entrepreneurial success
```

**Solution:**
- (A) "Definitely" is too strong for "most" → INVALID
- (B) "Probably" matches "most" → VALID ✓
- (C) "Exactly" is not supported → INVALID
- (D) Reverses the causation (success → hours ≠ hours → success) → INVALID

**Answer:** (B)

---

## 6. Course of Action

### The Singularity
> **"The right action solves the problem without creating new problems."**

### The Root Architecture

A good course of action must:
1. **Address the problem** directly
2. **Be feasible** to implement
3. **Not create worse problems**
4. **Be proportionate** to the issue

---

### 🔑 Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Question to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Relevance** | Does it address the stated problem? |
| **Feasibility** | Can it be realistically implemented? |
| **Side Effects** | Does it create new problems? |
| **Proportionality** | Is the response appropriate to the severity? |
| **Scope** | Is it within the authority of the actor? |

---

### 📝 Practice Problem

**Problem:**
```
Problem: "Air pollution in the city has reached dangerous levels."

Courses of Action:
I. Ban all vehicles from entering the city immediately.
II. Promote public transportation and cycling.
III. Require factories to install pollution control devices.

Which course(s) of action should be followed?

(A) Only I  (B) Only II  (C) II and III  (D) All three
```

**Solution:**
- I: Too extreme, not feasible (commerce stops) → NOT recommended
- II: Addresses root cause, feasible, proportionate → RECOMMENDED
- III: Addresses industrial pollution, feasible → RECOMMENDED

**Answer:** (C) II and III

---

## 7. Cause & Effect

### The Singularity
> **"Correlation is not causation. Timing is not causation. Only mechanism is causation."**

### The Root Architecture

Causal reasoning requires:
$$A \text{ causes } B \iff$$
1. A precedes B (temporal)
2. A correlates with B (association)
3. A's mechanism produces B (explanation)
4. No confounding variable explains both

---

### 🔑 Common Causal Fallacies

| Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Post Hoc** | After this, therefore because of this | "I wore red, we won" |
| **Correlation** | Correlated ≠ Caused | "Ice cream ↔ drowning" |
| **Reverse Causation** | Effect is actually the cause | "Happy people earn more" (or: money → happy?) |
| **Confounding** | Third variable causes both | "Coffee → lung cancer" (smokers drink coffee) |

---

### 🎯 Causal Argument Evaluation

```
Step 1: IDENTIFY the claimed cause and effect
Step 2: CHECK temporal order (cause before effect?)
Step 3: LOOK for alternative explanations
Step 4: CONSIDER reverse causation
Step 5: FIND confounding variables
Step 6: ASSESS if mechanism is plausible
```

---

### 📝 Practice Problem

**Problem:**
```
Study: "Students who eat breakfast score higher on exams."

Which statement, if true, would MOST weaken the causal claim that 
breakfast improves exam scores?

(A) Students who eat breakfast tend to sleep more
(B) Breakfast provides energy for brain function
(C) Students from wealthier families eat breakfast more often
(D) Some students skip breakfast due to morning sickness
```

**Solution:**
- (A) Sleep might be confounding factor, but breakfast still correlates with higher scores
- (B) STRENGTHENS the claim by providing mechanism
- (C) WEAKENS - wealth is confounding variable (wealth → breakfast AND wealth → better tutoring → scores) ✓
- (D) IRRELEVANT to the causal claim

**Answer:** (C)

## 8. Logical Fallacies

### The Singularity
> **"A fallacy is a broken bridge that LOOKS solid. Recognize the cracks."**

---

### 🔑 The 15 Critical Fallacies

| # | Fallacy | Description | Example |
|---|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Ad Hominem** | Attack the person, not the argument | "You're young, what do you know?" |
| 2 | **Straw Man** | Misrepresent opponent's argument | "You want to reduce military = you hate soldiers" |
| 3 | **False Dichotomy** | Only two options presented | "You're either with us or against us" |
| 4 | **Slippery Slope** | Extreme consequence without justification | "If we allow X, then Y, then Z disaster" |
| 5 | **Appeal to Authority** | Authority in wrong field | "Einstein believed in X, so X is true" (X ≠ physics) |
| 6 | **Appeal to Popularity** | Popular = True | "Everyone does it, so it's right" |
| 7 | **Appeal to Tradition** | Old = Good | "We've always done it this way" |
| 8 | **Appeal to Nature** | Natural = Good | "It's natural, so it's healthy" |
| 9 | **Circular Reasoning** | Conclusion in premises | "I'm right because I'm never wrong" |
| 10 | **Hasty Generalization** | Small sample to big conclusion | "I met two rude New Yorkers, all are rude" |
| 11 | **Post Hoc** | After = Because of | "I prayed, and it rained" |
| 12 | **Red Herring** | Distracting from the issue | "Why discuss climate when economy is bad?" |
| 13 | **False Cause** | Wrong causal relationship | "Crime ↑ as ice cream ↑ = ice cream causes crime" |
| 14 | **Appeal to Ignorance** | Can't disprove = True | "You can't prove X is false, so X is true" |
| 15 | **Equivocation** | Same word, different meanings | "A feather is light, light is fast, therefore a feather is fast" (conflates 'light' as weight vs. 'light' as illumination) |

---

### ⚠️ The Genius Trap

**Trap: Valid Form ≠ Sound Argument**
```
An argument can be VALID (structure is correct) but UNSOUND (premises are false).

Valid but Unsound:
  All fish can fly. (False premise)
  Salmon is a fish.
  Therefore, Salmon can fly. (Valid logic, false conclusion)
```

---

## 🧠 The Critical Reasoning Mnemonic: "PEACE"

- **P**remise - What's the evidence?
- **E**xplicit - What's stated?
- **A**ssumption - What's hidden?
- **C**onclusion - What's claimed?
- **E**valuation - Is it logical?

---

## 📊 Quick Reference: Question Type Strategy

| Question Type | What to Look For |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Assumption** | What MUST be true for argument to work? Use negation test. |
| **Strengthen** | What supports the assumption or adds evidence? |
| **Weaken** | What attacks assumption or provides counter-evidence? |
| **Inference** | What DEFINITELY follows? Avoid extreme language. |
| **Flaw** | What logical fallacy is present? |
| **Parallel** | What has same logical structure? |
| **Evaluate** | What would help determine if conclusion is right? |
