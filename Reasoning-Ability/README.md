## 🔥 The Golden Rules of Reasoning

### Rule 1: The Inversion Principle
> "Before solving, ask: What would make me select the WRONG answer?"

Every reasoning question has a **Genius Trap** - an option designed to catch intelligent students who over-think. Identify it first.

### Rule 2: The 80-20 Speed Law
> "80% of reasoning questions use 20% of the concepts."

Focus on mastering the high-frequency patterns:
- Analogies: Word relationships (cause-effect, part-whole, degree)
- Syllogisms: Universal vs Particular, Affirmative vs Negative
- Series: Addition, Multiplication, Fibonacci patterns
- Coding: Position-based, Reverse, Mixed encoding

### Rule 3: The Visualization Axiom
> "If you can't see it in your head, you can't solve it fast enough."

Build mental machinery:
- Blood Relations → Family Tree Visualization
- Directions → Mental Compass
- Arrangements → Visual Grid System

### Rule 4: The Elimination Doctrine
> "In MCQs, elimination is faster than solution."

For every question, first eliminate:
- Mathematically impossible options
- Logically contradictory choices
- Pattern-breaking alternatives

### Rule 5: The Precision Lock
> "In NAT questions, the last decimal decides your rank."

Always verify:
- Units and dimensions
- Rounding rules (typically 2-3 decimal places)
- Edge case validation
