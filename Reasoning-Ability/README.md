## 🔥 The Golden Rules of Reasoning

### Rule 1: The Inversion Principle
> "Before solving, ask: What would make me select the WRONG answer?"

Every reasoning question has a **Genius Trap** - an option designed to catch intelligent students who over-think. Identify it first.

### Rule 2: The 80-20 Speed Law
> "80% of reasoning questions use 20% of the concepts."

Focus on mastering the high-frequency patterns:
- Analogies: Word relationships (cause-effect, part-whole, degree)
- Syllogisms: Universal vs Particular, Affirmative vs Negative
- Series: Addition, Multiplication, Fibonacci patterns
- Coding: Position-based, Reverse, Mixed encoding

### Rule 3: The Visualization Axiom
> "If you can't see it in your head, you can't solve it fast enough."

Build mental machinery:
- Blood Relations → Family Tree Visualization
- Directions → Mental Compass
- Arrangements → Visual Grid System

### Rule 4: The Elimination Doctrine
> "In MCQs, elimination is faster than solution."

For every question, first eliminate:
- Mathematically impossible options
- Logically contradictory choices
- Pattern-breaking alternatives

### Rule 5: The Precision Lock
> "In NAT questions, the last decimal decides your rank."

Always verify:
- Units and dimensions
- Rounding rules (typically 2-3 decimal places)
- Edge case validation

## 🛠️ Universal Problem-Solving Techniques

### Technique 1: The Backward Solving Method
> **When:** Answer choices are numerical or specific options

```
Step 1: Start with the middle option (C in a 5-choice MCQ)
Step 2: Substitute into the problem
Step 3: If too high, try lower options; if too low, try higher
Step 4: Verify the correct option satisfies ALL conditions
```

**Why it works:** Saves time by eliminating half the options in each iteration.

### Technique 2: The Extreme Case Testing
> **When:** Problems involve ranges, sequences, or conditions

```
Step 1: Test with the smallest possible value (n=0, n=1)
Step 2: Test with a large value (n=100 or n→∞)
Step 3: Check boundary conditions
Step 4: If extreme cases work, the pattern is likely correct
```

**Example:** For series problems, verify your pattern at position 1 and position 10.

### Technique 3: The Elimination Matrix
> **When:** MCQ with 4-5 options and complex conditions

```
Step 1: Create a mental/physical table: Options vs Conditions
Step 2: Check each option against each condition
Step 3: Mark ✓ (satisfies) or ✗ (violates)
Step 4: Only one option should have all ✓ marks
```

### Technique 4: The Anchor Point Method
> **When:** Arrangement, scheduling, or ordering problems

```
Step 1: Identify the FIXED element (definite position given)
Step 2: Place it first—this is your "anchor"
Step 3: Build other positions relative to the anchor
Step 4: Use constraints to eliminate impossible arrangements
```

**Example:** "E sits at position 8" → Place E first, then work outward.

### Technique 5: The Pattern Recognition Ladder
> **When:** Series, coding, or sequence problems

```
Level 1: Check for constant difference (AP)
Level 2: Check for constant ratio (GP)
Level 3: Check for second-order differences
Level 4: Check for squares, cubes, primes, factorials
Level 5: Check for alternating or mixed patterns
```

**Rule:** Stop at the first level that explains the pattern.

### Technique 6: The Venn Diagram Visualization
> **When:** Syllogisms, set problems, logical deductions

```
Step 1: Draw circles for each set/category
Step 2: Mark definite regions (shaded = no elements, ★ = some exist)
Step 3: Check conclusion in ALL possible interpretations
Step 4: Conclusion is valid ONLY if true in every case
```

### Technique 7: The Time Boxing Strategy
> **When:** Exam time management

```
1-mark question: Maximum 1 minute
2-mark question: Maximum 2 minutes
If stuck beyond time limit: Mark for review, move on
```

**Priority Order:** High confidence → Medium confidence → Low confidence → Guesses

### Technique 8: The Substitution Technique
> **When:** Mathematical operations with symbols

```
Step 1: Take the given example: a ⊕ b = result
Step 2: Try basic operations: a+b, a-b, a×b, a÷b
Step 3: Try compound operations: a²+b², ab+a+b, |a-b|
Step 4: Verify pattern with ALL given examples
Step 5: Apply to the question
```

### Technique 9: The Tree Diagram Method
> **When:** Blood relations, hierarchical relationships

```
Step 1: Identify the reference person (usually "I" or a named person)
Step 2: Draw generations vertically (grandparents → parents → children)
Step 3: Draw siblings horizontally at the same level
Step 4: Use (+) for male, (−) for female, or (M)/(F) labels
Step 5: Trace the path from start to target
```

### Technique 10: The Coordinate Tracking Method
> **When:** Direction sense problems

```
Step 1: Set starting point as origin (0, 0)
Step 2: Track each movement:
        North: y += distance
        South: y -= distance
        East:  x += distance
        West:  x -= distance
Step 3: Calculate final position (x, y)
Step 4: Distance = √(x² + y²)
Step 5: Direction = quadrant analysis
```
