**Master Visualization:** Imagine a medieval kingdom where numbers live in perfect harmony through ratios.

#### 1.1 The Royal Palace of Ratios
- **Throne Room:** Basic ratios (a:b) sit on golden thrones
- **Antecedent Wing:** First terms wear blue crowns 👑
- **Consequent Wing:** Second terms wear red crowns 👑
- **Scaling Tower:** Where ratios multiply by same factors

**Memory Palace Route:**
1. Enter through **Simplification Gate** (GCD guards check your ratio)
2. Walk through **Duplicate Garden** (ratio flowers bloom twice as big)
3. Visit **Sub-duplicate Greenhouse** (square root plants)
4. Climb **Triplicate Tower** (cubic castle blocks)

#### 1.2 The Ratio Balance Scale ⚖️
**Visual Metaphor:** Every ratio is a balance scale
- **Left Pan:** Antecedent (first term)
- **Right Pan:** Consequent (second term)  
- **Balance Point:** The colon (:) or division line
- **Weight Adjustment:** Adding/subtracting same value tips the scale

**Memory Trigger:** "In Ratio Kingdom, balance means equality!"

### 2. Proportion Palace 🏛️

#### 2.1 The Four Pillars of Proportion
**Architectural Memory:** Classical building with four columns

**Pillar 3 (c):** **Mean Right** - painted silver
**Pillar 4 (d):** **Extreme Right** - painted gold

**Golden Rule:** Product of **Gold Pillars** = Product of **Silver Pillars**
**Formula Bridge:** ad = bc (extremes × means)

#### 2.2 The Proportion Rules Theater 🎭

**Stage Layout:** Five actors performing proportion transformations

**Actor C (Componendo):** Wears **ADD** costume (+), adds numerator to denominator
**Actor D (Dividendo):** Wears **SUBTRACT** costume (-), subtracts numerator from denominator  
**Actor I (Invertendo):** Wears **FLIP** costume, flips ratios upside down
**Actor A (Alternendo):** Wears **SWITCH** costume, switches the means
**Actor CD (Componendo-Dividendo):** Master actor combining C and D

**Memory Phrase:** "**Can I Act Dramatically?**" = **C-I-A-D** sequence
