# Tips, Tricks, Techniques & Shortcuts - Percentage

## Master Techniques for GATE 2026 CSE AIR 1

### 1. Lightning-Fast Percentage Calculations

#### 1.1 Mental Math Shortcuts for Common Percentages

**The "Split and Multiply" Technique**
```
25% = 1/4 → Divide by 4
50% = 1/2 → Divide by 2  
75% = 3/4 → 3 × (number ÷ 4)
33⅓% = 1/3 → Divide by 3
66⅔% = 2/3 → 2 × (number ÷ 3)
```

**The "10% Base" Method**
```
Step 1: Find 10% (move decimal one place left)
Step 2: Use 10% to build other percentages

Example: 30% of 240
10% of 240 = 24
30% = 3 × 10% = 3 × 24 = 72

Example: 15% of 80
10% of 80 = 8
5% = 10% ÷ 2 = 4
15% = 10% + 5% = 8 + 4 = 12
```

#### 1.2 Advanced Mental Calculation Techniques

**The "Cross-Multiplication Shortcut"**
For finding what percentage A is of B:
```
Instead of: (A/B) × 100
Use: Cross multiply A × 100, then divide by B mentally

Example: What % is 18 of 72?
18 × 100 = 1800
1800 ÷ 72 = 25%

Quick Division Trick: 72 × 25 = 1800 (since 25 × 4 = 100, and 72 × 4 = 288)
```

**The "Compensation Method"**
```
When numbers are close to round numbers:
23% of 97 ≈ 23% of 100 - 23% of 3
= 23 - 0.69 ≈ 22.31

Memory Aid: "Compensate to Calculate"
```

### 2. Speed Techniques for Percentage-Fraction Conversions

#### 2.1 Instant Recognition Patterns

**The "Fraction Family" Method**
Memorize these families for instant conversion:

**Quarters Family:**
- 1/4 = 25%
- 2/4 = 50% 
- 3/4 = 75%

**Fifths Family:**
- 1/5 = 20%
- 2/5 = 40%
- 3/5 = 60%
- 4/5 = 80%

**Eighths Family:**
- 1/8 = 12.5%
- 3/8 = 37.5%
- 5/8 = 62.5%
- 7/8 = 87.5%

**Memory Technique:** "Family Trees Never Forget"

#### 2.2 Complex Fraction Shortcuts

**The "Denominator Recognition" Technique**
```
For 1/n percentages:
1/7 = 14²/₇% (Remember: 100 ÷ 7 = 14 remainder 2)
1/9 = 11¹/₉% (Remember: 100 ÷ 9 = 11 remainder 1)
1/11 = 9¹/₁₁% (Remember: 100 ÷ 11 = 9 remainder 1)
1/13 = 7⁹/₁₃% (Remember: 100 ÷ 13 = 7 remainder 9)
```

**Quick Conversion Formula:**
```
1/n = (100 ÷ n)% with remainder as mixed number
```

### 3. Multiplication Factor Mastery

#### 3.1 Instant Factor Recognition

**The "Factor Table" Method**
Memorize these for 2-second calculations:

```
Increase Factors:
10% → 1.1    20% → 1.2    25% → 1.25    33⅓% → 4/3
50% → 1.5    60% → 1.6    75% → 1.75    100% → 2

Decrease Factors:
10% → 0.9    20% → 0.8    25% → 0.75    33⅓% → 2/3
50% → 0.5    60% → 0.4    75% → 0.25    40% → 0.6
```

**Memory Aid:** "Factors are Friends, Use Them to Win"

#### 3.2 Complex Factor Calculations

**The "Fraction Factor" Technique**
```
Instead of decimals, use fractions for exact calculations:

25% increase = 5/4 factor
33⅓% decrease = 2/3 factor  
16⅔% increase = 7/6 factor
14²/₇% decrease = 6/7 factor

Example: Price increases by 25%, then decreases by 20%
Factors: 5/4 × 4/5 = 1 (no net change!)
```

### 4. Successive Percentage Super-Tricks

#### 4.1 The "Formula Pyramid" Method

**Level 1: Basic Two Changes**
```
Net% = x + y + xy/100

Memory Technique: "Add, Add, Cross-Divide"
Example: +20% then +15%
= 20 + 15 + (20×15)/100 = 35 + 3 = 38%
```

**Level 2: Three Changes**
```
First find net of any two, then apply formula again

Example: +10%, +20%, -5%
Step 1: Net of +10% and +20% = 10 + 20 + 200/100 = 32%
Step 2: +32% and -5% = 32 - 5 - 160/100 = 25.4%
```

**Level 3: Pattern Recognition**
```
Same percentage n times:
- (+10%)³ = (1.1)³ = 1.331 = 33.1% increase
- (-10%)³ = (0.9)³ = 0.729 = 27.1% decrease
```

#### 4.2 Advanced Successive Change Shortcuts

**The "Symmetry Trick"**
```
+x% followed by -x% ≠ No change
Net change = -x²/100%

Example: +20% then -20%
Net = -(20)²/100 = -400/100 = -4% (decrease)

Memory Aid: "Symmetry Deceives, Square Reveals"
```

**The "Reverse Engineering" Method**
```
To nullify +x% change, apply -(x/(100+x))×100% change

Example: To nullify +25% increase
Required decrease = 25/(100+25) × 100 = 25/125 × 100 = 20%

Verification: 1.25 × 0.8 = 1 ✓
```

### 5. Base Change Lightning Techniques

#### 5.1 The "Reciprocal Relationship" Method

**Quick Base Change Formula:**
```
If A is x% more than B → B is x/(100+x) × 100% less than A
If A is x% less than B → B is x/(100-x) × 100% more than A
```

**Speed Calculation Trick:**
```
For x% more → Decrease = x/(1+x/100) in decimal
For x% less → Increase = x/(1-x/100) in decimal

Example: A is 50% more than B
B is 50/150 × 100 = 33⅓% less than A

Memory Aid: "More means Less, Less means More, Adjust the Shore"
```

#### 5.2 Advanced Base Change Applications

**The "Ratio Method"**
```
When A:B = m:n
A is [(m-n)/n] × 100% more/less than B
B is [(n-m)/m] × 100% more/less than A

Example: If A:B = 5:4
A is (5-4)/4 × 100 = 25% more than B
B is (4-5)/5 × 100 = -20% (20% less) than A
```

### 6. Memory Techniques and Mnemonics

#### 6.1 The "Percentage Palace" Method

**Room 1: Basic Conversions**
Visualize a room with:
- A quarter (25¢) for 25% = 1/4
- A half-dollar (50¢) for 50% = 1/2
- Three quarters (75¢) for 75% = 3/4

**Room 2: Fraction Families**
- A family of 5 people for fifths (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%)
- A family of 8 people for eighths (12.5%, 37.5%, etc.)

**Room 3: Formula Workshop**
- A plus sign (+), another plus sign (+), and multiplication (×) for successive changes
- A see-saw for base changes (more on one side, less on other)

#### 6.2 Story-Based Memory Techniques

**The "Percentage Detective" Story**
```
Detective P. Cent always follows three clues:
1. Find the PART (numerator)
2. Find the WHOLE (denominator)  
3. Multiply by 100 (magnifying glass)

Story: "Detective P. Cent uses his magnifying glass (×100) to examine the part-to-whole ratio in every case."
```

**The "Successive Twins" Story**
```
Twins Add and Multiply always work together:
First Add does: x + y
Then Multiply does: xy/100
Together they give: x + y + xy/100

Story: "The Successive Twins never work alone - Add prepares the ground, Multiply adds the twist."
```

### 7. Shortcut Patterns for GATE Questions

#### 7.1 Instant Recognition Patterns

**Pattern 1: "Double Trouble"**
```
When same percentage appears twice:
+20% then +20% → Use (1.2)² = 1.44 → 44% increase
-15% then -15% → Use (0.85)² = 0.7225 → 27.75% decrease
```

**Pattern 2: "Complementary Pairs"**
```
25% and 75% are complementary (sum to 100%)
33⅓% and 66⅔% are complementary
40% and 60% are complementary

Quick trick: If you know one, the other is (100 - known%)
```

**Pattern 3: "Factor Friends"**
```
Some factors are related:
1.25 × 0.8 = 1 (25% increase cancels 20% decrease)
1.5 × 0.667 ≈ 1 (50% increase ≈ cancels 33⅓% decrease)
```

#### 7.2 GATE-Specific Speed Techniques

**The "Options Elimination" Method**
```
When choices are far apart, use approximations:
- Round percentages to nearest 5 or 10
- Use benchmark fractions
- Eliminate obviously wrong options first
```

**The "Back-Substitution" Trick**
```
Sometimes it's faster to check options than solve:
- Plug answer choices back into the problem
- Use process of elimination
- Verify with approximate calculations
```

### 8. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

#### 8.1 The "Percentage Pitfalls"

**Pitfall 1: Base Confusion**
```
Wrong: "If A is 20% more than B, then B is 20% less than A"
Right: "If A is 20% more than B, then B is 16⅔% less than A"

Memory Aid: "Different bases, different races"
```

**Pitfall 2: Formula Mix-up**
```
Wrong: Net change = x + y (forgetting xy/100 term)
Right: Net change = x + y + xy/100

Memory Aid: "Don't forget the cross-term"
```

**Pitfall 3: Sign Errors**
```
Increase: Use + sign
Decrease: Use - sign
Mixed changes: Be careful with signs in formula

Memory Aid: "Signs matter, check the ladder"
```

### 9. Time-Saving Calculator Alternatives

#### 9.1 Mental Division Techniques

**The "Factor Method"**
```
To divide by difficult numbers, factorize:
÷ 25 = ÷ 100 × 4 = × 0.04
÷ 75 = ÷ 100 × 4/3 = × 0.04 × 4/3
÷ 125 = ÷ 1000 × 8 = × 0.008
```

**The "Multiplication Alternative"**
```
Instead of dividing by fractions, multiply by reciprocals:
÷ 3/4 = × 4/3
÷ 2/5 = × 5/2
÷ 7/8 = × 8/7
```

#### 9.2 Estimation Mastery

**The "Boundary Method"**
```
Create upper and lower bounds:
Example: 23% of 167
Lower bound: 20% of 160 = 32
Upper bound: 25% of 170 = 42.5
Answer should be between 32 and 42.5
Actual: 23% of 167 ≈ 38.4 ✓
```
