# Profit & Loss - Quick Notes Cheatsheet 📋

## ⚡ Key Formulas & Shortcuts

### Universal Profit Equations (UPE)
```
Profit% = (SP - CP)/CP × 100
Loss% = (CP - SP)/CP × 100
SP = CP × (100 ± Profit%)/100
CP = SP × 100/(100 ± Profit%)
```

### Marked Price & Discount Shortcuts
```
MP = CP × (100 + markup%)/100
SP = MP × (100 - discount%)/100
Discount% = (MP - SP)/MP × 100
```

### False Weight Lightning Formula
```
Gain% = (Error in weight/True weight) × 100
If sells x gm instead of 1000 gm:
Gain% = (1000 - x)/x × 100
```

### Partnership Profit Division
```
Profit ratio = Investment ratio × Time ratio
For equal time: Ratio = Investment ratio
For equal investment: Ratio = Time ratio
```

## 🧠 Memory Aids

### Profit Palace Visualization
- **CP Castle**: Cost Price foundation
- **SP Spire**: Selling Price tower
- **Profit Bridge**: Connects CP to SP (upward)
- **Loss Tunnel**: Goes from SP below CP

### Character Associations
- **Captain Cost**: Always at the base (CP)
- **Sergeant Sell**: Higher or lower than CP (SP)
- **Major Markup**: Increases MP above CP
- **General Gain**: Celebrates profits

### Quick Recall Formulas
- "SP over CP minus one times hundred" (Profit%)
- "CP over SP minus one times hundred" (Loss%)
- "Discount adds, then multiply divides" (Successive discounts)

## 📊 Speed Calculation Tricks

### Lightning Profit% Calculation
```
If SP = 120, CP = 100
Profit% = (120-100)/100 × 100 = 20%
Quick: (SP/CP - 1) × 100
```

### Instant Discount Calculation
```
Two successive discounts of 10% and 20%:
Net = 10 + 20 - (10×20)/100 = 28%
Final price = 72% of marked price
```

### Rapid False Weight Solution
```
Shopkeeper uses 800g instead of 1000g:
Gain% = (1000-800)/800 × 100 = 25%
```

### Quick Partnership Division
```
A invests 3000 for 4 months
B invests 4000 for 3 months
Ratio = (3000×4):(4000×3) = 12000:12000 = 1:1
```

## 🔥 Advanced Shortcuts

### UPE Speed Application
```
Method 1: Direct percentage = (SP-CP)/CP × 100
Method 2: Multiplier = SP/CP, then (multiplier-1) × 100
```

### QDT for Multiple Discounts
```
3 successive discounts a%, b%, c%:
Step 1: Net of first two = a + b - ab/100
Step 2: Apply formula again with result and c
```

### AFWF Weight Manipulation
```
To gain x%: Use weight = 1000/(1 + x/100) grams
To lose x%: Use weight = 1000/(1 - x/100) grams
```

## 📊 Common Mistake Prevention

❌ **Avoid**: Confusing profit% with markup%
✅ **Do**: Always base on cost price for profit%

❌ **Avoid**: Adding discounts directly
✅ **Do**: Use successive discount formula

❌ **Avoid**: Calculating each transaction separately
✅ **Do**: Use overall gain/loss method

❌ **Avoid**: Ignoring time factor in partnerships
✅ **Do**: Always multiply investment by time
