## ✅ ANSWER KEY

### High Priority Solutions (Q1-Q40)

**Q1**: CP = 960/1.2 = ₹800, New SP = ₹1080, Profit% = (1080-800)/800 × 100 = 35%

**Q2**: MP = 1.25 × CP, SP = 0.9 × MP = 0.9 × 1.25 × CP = 1.125 × CP, Profit% = 12.5%

**Q3**: New CP = 1.2 × CP, New SP = 1.3 × SP = 1.3 × 1.15 × CP = 1.495 × CP
New Profit% = (1.495 × CP - 1.2 × CP)/(1.2 × CP) × 100 = 24.58%

**Q4**: CP per orange = 5/12, SP per orange = 6/10 = 0.6
Profit% = (0.6 - 5/12)/(5/12) × 100 = 44%

**Q5**: SP of 15 = CP of 18, CP of 15 : SP of 15 = 15 : 18 = 5 : 6
Profit% = (6-5)/5 × 100 = 20%

**Q6**: Final price = 2000 × 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.85 = ₹1224

**Q7**: CP of 20 = SP of 16, SP:CP = 20:16 = 5:4, Profit% = (5-4)/4 × 100 = 25%

**Q8**: CP = 27/1.125 = ₹24, For 25% profit, SP = 24 × 1.25 = ₹30

**Q9**: Required SP = 200 × 1.2 = ₹240, Discount = 300 - 240 = ₹60
Discount% = 60/300 × 100 = 20%

**Q10**: CP₁ = 500/1.25 = ₹400, CP₂ = 500/0.75 = ₹666.67
Total CP = ₹1066.67, Total SP = ₹1000, Loss% = 6.25%
