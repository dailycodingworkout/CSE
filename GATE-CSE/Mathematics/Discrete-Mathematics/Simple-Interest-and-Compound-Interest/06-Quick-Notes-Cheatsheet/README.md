# Simple Interest & Compound Interest - Quick Notes Cheatsheet 📋

## ⚡ Key Formulas & Shortcuts

### Universal Interest Calculator (UIC) Formulas
```
Simple Interest: SI = (P × R × T)/100
Amount: A = P + SI = P(1 + RT/100)
Compound Interest: CI = P(1 + R/100)^T - P
Compound Amount: A = P(1 + R/100)^T
```

### Lightning CI-SI Difference Formulas
```
For 2 years: Diff = P × R²/(100)²
For 3 years: Diff = P × R² × (300 + R)/(100)³
General: Diff = P[(1 + R/100)^T - (1 + RT/100)]
```

### Instant Rate Conversion
```
Monthly rate = Annual rate/12
Quarterly rate = Annual rate/4
Half-yearly rate = Annual rate/2
```

### Quick Doubling & Tripling Time
```
Doubling time ≈ 72/R (Rule of 72)
Tripling time ≈ 115/R (Rule of 115)
Quadrupling time ≈ 144/R (Rule of 144)
```

## 📊 Speed Calculation Tricks

### Lightning SI Calculation
```
P = 1000, R = 10%, T = 2 years
SI = 1000 × 10 × 2 / 100 = 200
Quick: Move decimal two places: 1000 × 0.1 × 2 = 200
```

### Instant CI Calculation (Small rates)
```
P = 1000, R = 5%, T = 2 years
CI ≈ SI + (SI × R/200) = 50 + 1.25 = 51.25
Exact: 1000 × (1.05)² - 1000 = 102.5
```

### Rapid Difference Calculation
```
P = 10000, R = 10%, T = 2 years
Diff = 10000 × 10² / 10000 = 100
For 3 years: 10000 × 100 × 310 / 1000000 = 310
```

### Quick Rate Finding
```
If amount doubles in 10 years with CI:
2 = (1 + R/100)^10
R ≈ 7.2% (using rule of 72: 72/10 = 7.2)
```

## 🔥 Advanced Shortcuts

### UIC Speed Methods
```
Method 1: Direct substitution in formula
Method 2: Multiplier approach for CI
Method 3: Percentage shortcuts for mental math
```

### IDP Pattern Recognition
```
2-year difference: Always P×R²/10000
3-year difference: P×R²×(300+R)/1000000
4-year difference: Use successive application
```

### QCT Frequency Conversion
```
Annual to Monthly: Divide rate by 12, multiply time by 12
Effective rate = (1 + r/n)^n - 1 where n = frequency
```

## 📊 Common Mistake Prevention

❌ **Avoid**: Using SI formula for CI problems
✅ **Do**: Identify interest type first

❌ **Avoid**: Calculating CI by finding SI for each year
✅ **Do**: Use direct CI formula

❌ **Avoid**: Forgetting to subtract principal from amount
✅ **Do**: Always check if answer asks for interest or amount

❌ **Avoid**: Using annual rate for monthly compounding
✅ **Do**: Convert rate according to compounding frequency

## 🎯 Instant Recognition Patterns

### Problem Type Indicators
- "Simple Interest" → Use SI formula
- "Compound Interest" → Use CI formula  
- "Difference between CI and SI" → Use IDP formula
- "What rate" → Use rate finding techniques
- "In how much time" → Use time calculation methods

### Quick Estimation Methods
- For small rates: CI ≈ SI + small correction
- For doubling: Use rule of 72
- For tripling: Use rule of 115
- For large numbers: Use scientific notation
