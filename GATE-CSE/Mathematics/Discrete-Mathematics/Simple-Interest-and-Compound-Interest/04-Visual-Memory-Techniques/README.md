**Memory Technique**:
- **Time = Clock Faces** (years, months, days)
- Each face shows different time periods
- Pendulum swings show time progression
- **Connection**: "Time tower shows how long money grows"

### Room 3: The Rate Garden (Foundation Vault)
**Visual Anchor**: A garden with percentage flowers
**Memory Technique**:
- **Rate = Blooming Percentage Flowers**
- 5% = 5 petals, 10% = 10 petals
- Higher rates = bigger, brighter flowers

### Room 4: The Simple Interest Library (Level 2)
**Visual Anchor**: A linear bookshelf with equal-sized books
**Memory Technique**:
- **SI = Books of Equal Size** (constant interest)
- Each year adds one identical book
- Books stack in straight line

- **Gap between bridges** = P(R/100)²
- Gap widens with higher rates and longer time

**Visual Trigger**:
🌉 - 🛤️ = 👸(🌸/💯)²

### 4. Half-yearly Compounding Formula Twins
**Visual Twins**: Twin Rate Flowers
```
A = P(1 + R/200)^(2n)
```
**Memory Story**:

## Pattern Recognition Methods

### 1. The Number Pattern Detective System

#### Simple Interest Patterns
**Visual Pattern**: Arithmetic Progression Ladder
```
Year 0: P
Year 1: P + SI
Year 2: P + 2SI
Year 3: P + 3SI
```
**Memory Aid**: "SI creates equal steps on ladder"
**Visual**: 📈 (straight line graph)

#### Compound Interest Patterns
**Visual Pattern**: Geometric Progression Spiral
```
Year 0: P
Year 1: P(1+r)
Year 2: P(1+r)²
Year 3: P(1+r)³
```
**Memory Aid**: "CI creates expanding spiral"
**Visual**: 🌀 (exponential curve)

### 2. The Rate Recognition Radar

#### Common Rate Conversions
**Visual Radar**: Percentage Flowers Garden
```
5% = 1/20 = 0.05
10% = 1/10 = 0.1
12.5% = 1/8 = 0.125
16⅔% = 1/6 = 0.167
20% = 1/5 = 0.2
25% = 1/4 = 0.25
```
