# Time, Speed & Distance - Quick Notes Cheatsheet 📋

## ⚡ Key Formulas & Shortcuts

### Universal Speed Calculator (USC) Formulas
```
Basic: Speed = Distance/Time, Distance = Speed × Time, Time = Distance/Speed
Unit Conversion: 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s, 1 m/s = 18/5 km/hr
Average Speed = Total Distance/Total Time
Relative Speed: Same direction (S₁-S₂), Opposite direction (S₁+S₂)
```

### Lightning Train Formulas
```
Train crossing stationary object: Time = Length_train/Speed_train
Train crossing moving object: Time = (L₁+L₂)/(S₁±S₂)
Overtaking: Time = Length_difference/Relative_speed
```

### Instant Relative Motion
```
Meeting Time = Total Distance/(S₁+S₂)
Catching Time = Initial Gap/(S₁-S₂)
Circular Track: Meeting time = Track_length/(S₁+S₂) [opposite]
Circular Track: Overtaking time = Track_length/(S₁-S₂) [same direction]
```

### Quick Boat-River Calculations
```
Downstream Speed = Boat + River
Upstream Speed = Boat - River
Boat Speed = (Downstream + Upstream)/2
River Speed = (Downstream - Upstream)/2
```

## 📊 Speed Calculation Tricks

### Lightning Unit Conversion
```
72 km/hr to m/s: 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s
Quick: Multiply by 5, divide by 18
45 m/s to km/hr: 45 × 18/5 = 162 km/hr
Quick: Multiply by 18, divide by 5
```

### Instant Relative Speed
```
Car A: 60 km/hr, Car B: 40 km/hr
Same direction: 60-40 = 20 km/hr
Opposite direction: 60+40 = 100 km/hr
```

### Rapid Train Calculation
```
Train length 200m, speed 60 km/hr = 50/3 m/s
Time to cross pole = 200 ÷ (50/3) = 200 × 3/50 = 12 seconds
```

### Quick Boat Speed Finding
```
Downstream: 15 km/hr, Upstream: 9 km/hr
Boat speed = (15+9)/2 = 12 km/hr
River speed = (15-9)/2 = 3 km/hr
```

## 🔥 Advanced Shortcuts

### USC Speed Applications
```
For ratios: Use proportional method
For averages: Total distance ÷ total time
For variables: Set up equations directly
```

### IDP Distance Prediction
```
Constant speed: D = S × T
Variable speed: Break into segments
Relative motion: Use gap closure/creation
```

### QMT Motion Theory
```
Same plane, same direction: Subtract speeds
Same plane, opposite direction: Add speeds
One on another, same direction: Add speeds
One on another, opposite direction: Subtract speeds
```

### ATF Train Optimization
```
Train vs stationary: Use train length only
Train vs train: Use sum of lengths
Train vs platform: Use train length + platform length
Overtaking: Use length difference
```

## 📊 Common Mistake Prevention

❌ **Avoid**: Using train length for stationary object crossing
✅ **Do**: Use combined lengths for moving objects

❌ **Avoid**: Mixing up same and opposite direction formulas
✅ **Do**: Visualize motion direction first

❌ **Avoid**: Adding speeds for boat in still water
✅ **Do**: Use upstream/downstream for river problems

❌ **Avoid**: Using simple average for average speed
✅ **Do**: Use total distance/total time

## 🚀 Mental Calculation Techniques

### Quick Unit Switching
```
km/hr to m/s: Divide by 3.6 (or multiply by 5/18)
m/s to km/hr: Multiply by 3.6 (or multiply by 18/5)
For mental math: 5/18 ≈ 0.28, 18/5 = 3.6
```

### Relative Speed Shortcuts
```
When speeds are close: Focus on difference
When speeds are very different: Faster speed dominates
For equal speeds: Same direction = 0, opposite = 2×speed
```

### Train Length Calculations
```
Train length = Speed × Time (when crossing stationary object)
Combined length = (S₁ + S₂) × Time (when trains meet)
Platform length = Total distance - Train length
```

### Average Speed Optimization
```
Equal distances, different speeds: Use harmonic mean
Equal times, different speeds: Use arithmetic mean
General case: Always use total distance/total time
```

## 📈 Advanced Problem Types

### Circular Track Problems
```
Same direction meeting: Time = Track_length/(S₁-S₂)
Opposite direction meeting: Time = Track_length/(S₁+S₂)
Number of meetings in time T: T × relative_speed/track_length
```

### Race Problems
```
A gives B a start of x meters: A covers (L+x) when B covers L
A gives B a time start of t seconds: Account for B's head start
Dead heat: Both finish simultaneously
```

### Variable Speed Problems
```
Acceleration: Use kinematic equations
Deceleration: Account for changing speed
Multi-segment journey: Calculate each segment separately
```

### Complex Relative Motion
```
3 objects moving: Consider pairwise relative speeds
Motion on inclined planes: Break into components
Circular motion: Use angular speeds and radii
```

## 🔥 Lightning Problem Solving

### 3-Second Solutions
```
Distance = 180 km, Time = 3 hours
Speed = 180/3 = 60 km/hr

Speed = 25 m/s
In km/hr = 25 × 18/5 = 90 km/hr
```

### 4-Second Complex Problems
```
Train A: 120m, 80 km/hr
Train B: 180m, 60 km/hr, opposite direction
Time to cross = (120+180)/(80+60) × 18/5 = 300/140 × 18/5 = 7.7 seconds
```

### 5-Second Multi-Step Problems
```
Boat downstream: 24 km in 2 hours = 12 km/hr
Boat upstream: 16 km in 2 hours = 8 km/hr
Boat speed = (12+8)/2 = 10 km/hr
River speed = (12-8)/2 = 2 km/hr
```
