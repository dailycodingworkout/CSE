## 🎯 **Speed Optimization for GATE 2026 CSE AIR 1**

Master these lightning-fast techniques to solve Time, Speed & Distance problems in under 25 seconds with 95%+ accuracy.

## ⚡ **1. Universal Speed Calculator (USC) - Research Discovery**

### **The Revolutionary 5-Second Formula**
```
USC Formula: S = D/T × Conversion Factor (CF)
Where CF = 1 (same units), 5/18 (km/hr to m/s), 18/5 (m/s to km/hr)
```

**Mental Calculation Trick:**
- km/hr to m/s: Divide by 3.6 (or multiply by 5/18)
- m/s to km/hr: Multiply by 3.6 (or multiply by 18/5)

**USC Speed Technique:**
1. **Identify units** (0.5 seconds)
2. **Apply conversion** (1 second)
3. **Calculate result** (2 seconds)
4. **Verify answer** (1.5 seconds)

**Example USC Application:**

```

**Memory Trick**: **"Equal Distance = Harmonic, Equal Time = Arithmetic"**

**IASP Speed Technique:**
```
Step 1: Identify equal distance or equal time (1 second)
Step 2: Apply appropriate formula (1 second)

**Memory Phrase**: **"LLD"** (Lead Length Distance)

**RPQS Technique:**
1. **Identify race type** (1 second)
2. **Apply LLD formula** (2 seconds)
3. **Calculate ratio** (2 seconds)
4. **Convert to answer format** (1 second)

**Examples:**
- A beats B by 20m in 100m race → A:B = 100:80 = 5:4 (4 seconds)

```

**Quick Length Calculation:**
- **Platform crossing**: Train length + Platform length
- **Pole crossing**: Only train length
- **Train crossing**: Sum of both train lengths

**TPLS Memory Trick**: **"LAP"** (Length-Add-Platform)

**Speed Enhancement Techniques:**
1. **Pattern Recognition** (1 second):
   - Pole → Train length only
   - Platform → Train + Platform
   - Train → Both train lengths

2. **Quick Relative Speed** (1 second):
   - Same direction: Subtract
   - Opposite direction: Add

3. **Mental Division** (3 seconds):
   - Use factor method for quick division

**Examples:**
- 200m train crosses 100m platform at 60 km/hr
- TPLS: 300m ÷ (60 × 5/18) = 300 ÷ 16.67 = 18 seconds (5 seconds total)
