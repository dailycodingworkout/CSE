# Time & Work - Quick Notes Cheatsheet 📋

## ⚡ Key Formulas & Shortcuts

### Universal Work Calculator (UWC) Formulas
```
Basic Relation: Work = Rate × Time
Rate = 1/Time (when total work = 1 unit)
Combined Rate: 1/A + 1/B + 1/C = 1/Combined_Time
Work Done = Rate × Time_Worked
```

### Lightning Efficiency Shortcuts
```
If A is n times efficient than B: Time_A = Time_B/n
Efficiency Ratio = Inverse of Time Ratio
A:B:C (efficiency) = 1/a : 1/b : 1/c (where a,b,c are days)
```

### Instant Pipes & Cisterns
```
Filling rate = 1/Filling_time (positive)
Emptying rate = 1/Emptying_time (negative)
Net rate = Sum of all rates
Time to fill/empty = 1/Net_rate
```

### Quick Man-Day Calculations
```
Total Work = Man × Days × Hours
M₁D₁H₁/W₁ = M₂D₂H₂/W₂
If work changes: Scale proportionally
```

## 📊 Speed Calculation Tricks

### Lightning Combined Work
```
A completes work in 6 days, B in 9 days
Combined time = (6 × 9)/(6 + 9) = 54/15 = 3.6 days
Quick: Product over sum for two workers
```

### Instant Efficiency Calculation
```
A is 3 times efficient than B
If B takes 12 days, A takes 12/3 = 4 days
Together: (4 × 12)/(4 + 12) = 48/16 = 3 days
```

### Rapid Pipes Solution
```
Pipe A fills in 4 hours, Pipe B empties in 6 hours
Net rate = 1/4 - 1/6 = 3/12 - 2/12 = 1/12
Time to fill = 12 hours
```

### Quick Man-Day Calculation
```
15 men complete work in 8 days
How many men for 6 days?
Men needed = (15 × 8)/6 = 120/6 = 20 men
```

## 🔥 Advanced Shortcuts

### UWC Speed Applications
```
Two workers: T = (T₁ × T₂)/(T₁ + T₂)
Three workers: T = 1/(1/T₁ + 1/T₂ + 1/T₃)
n workers with equal efficiency: T = Individual_time/n
```

### IEM Efficiency Mapping
```
Efficiency ratio = 1/Time ratio
If A:B = 3:2 (efficiency), then Time_A:Time_B = 2:3
Work distribution ∝ Efficiency ratio
```

### QWDA Distribution Formula
```
Work done by person i = Total_work × (Efficiency_i/Total_efficiency)
Time ratio = Inverse of efficiency ratio
Individual contribution = Efficiency × Time worked
```

### APFO Flow Optimization
```
Multiple inlets: Add all positive rates
Multiple outlets: Add all negative rates  
Net rate = Total positive - Total negative
Critical: If net negative, tank will never fill
```

## 📊 Common Mistake Prevention

❌ **Avoid**: Adding times directly for combined work
✅ **Do**: Add rates, then take reciprocal

❌ **Avoid**: Confusing efficiency with time
✅ **Do**: Remember inverse relationship

❌ **Avoid**: Treating all pipes as filling pipes
✅ **Do**: Check if pipe fills or empties

❌ **Avoid**: Ignoring work scaling in man-day problems
✅ **Do**: Scale work proportionally when changed

## 🚀 Mental Calculation Techniques

### Quick Rate Addition
```
Rates: 1/6, 1/9, 1/18
LCM of 6,9,18 = 18
Rates: 3/18, 2/18, 1/18
Sum: 6/18 = 1/3
Combined time: 3 units
```

### Efficiency Conversion
```
A:B:C = 3:2:1 (efficiency)
Time ratio = 1:1.5:3
If total time for all = T, individual times: T/3, 1.5T/3, 3T/3
```

### Pipe Flow Balance
```
Filling rates: 1/4, 1/6 per hour
Emptying rate: 1/8 per hour
Net rate = 1/4 + 1/6 - 1/8 = 6/24 + 4/24 - 3/24 = 7/24
Time = 24/7 hours
```

### Man-Day Scaling
```
Original: 20 men, 15 days
New requirement: 12 days
Men needed = (20 × 15)/12 = 300/12 = 25 men
Additional = 25 - 20 = 5 men
```

## 📈 Advanced Problem Types

### Alternate Work Patterns
```
A and B work on alternate days starting with A
A's rate = 1/6, B's rate = 1/9
In 2 days: Work done = 1/6 + 1/9 = 5/18
Time for complete work = 2 × (18/5) = 7.2 days
```

### Work with Breaks
```
A works for 2 days, rests 1 day, pattern repeats
In 3-day cycle: Work done = 2 × (1/6) = 1/3
Number of complete cycles = 3
Remaining work = 0, so 9 days total
```

### Variable Efficiency
```
A's efficiency increases by 10% each day
Day 1: 1/10, Day 2: 1.1/10, Day 3: 1.21/10
Sum until work completes using geometric progression
```
