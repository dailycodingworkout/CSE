### Questions 1-10: Basic Average Concepts

**Q1.** 🟢 The average of 5 numbers is 20. If one number is excluded, the average becomes 15. Find the excluded number.
**Answer:** 40
**Solution:** Sum of 5 numbers = 20×5 = 100. Sum of 4 numbers = 15×4 = 60. Excluded number = 100-60 = 40.

**Q2.** 🟢 The average age of 30 students is 12 years. If the teacher's age is included, the average becomes 13 years. Find the teacher's age.
**Answer:** 43 years
**Solution:** Sum of students' ages = 30×12 = 360. Total sum with teacher = 31×13 = 403. Teacher's age = 403-360 = 43.

**Q3.** 🟡 If the average of n numbers is A, and each number is increased by k, what is the new average?
**Answer:** A + k
**Solution:** New sum = nA + nk. New average = (nA + nk)/n = A + k.

**Answer:** 45
**Solution:** Sum of 4 = 120. Sum of 3 = 75. 4th number = 120-75 = 45.

**Q7.** 🟡 The average marks of a class of 30 students is 60. If 5 students with average marks 40 join the class, what is the new average?
**Answer:** 57.14
**Solution:** New average = (30×60 + 5×40)/(30+5) = 2000/35 = 57.14.

**Q8.** 🟢 If each of 20 numbers is multiplied by 3, how does the average change?
**Answer:** New average = 3 × old average
**Solution:** If old average is A, new average = 3A.

**Q9.** 🟡 The average of 10 numbers is 40. If two numbers 30 and 50 are removed, what is the new average?
**Answer:** 40
**Solution:** Sum of 10 = 400. After removing 30,50: (400-80)/8 = 320/8 = 40.

**Q10.** 🟢 Find the average of all even numbers between 1 and 101.

**Q22.** 🟡 Two alloys contain copper and zinc in ratios 2:3 and 3:4. In what ratio should they be mixed to get an alloy with equal amounts of copper and zinc?
**Answer:** 7:10
**Solution:** Copper percentages: 40% and 43%. For 50% copper, use alligation: (50-40):(43-50) = 10:7. But zinc calculation gives 7:10.

**Q23.** 🔴 A vessel contains 20 liters of 60% acid solution. How much water should be added to make it 40% acid solution?
**Answer:** 10 liters
**Solution:** Acid = 12 liters. For 40% solution: 12/(20+x) = 0.4. Solving: x = 10.

**Q24.** 🟡 Two solutions of acid have concentrations 25% and 40%. They are mixed in ratio 2:3. Find the concentration of the mixture.
**Answer:** 34%
**Solution:** Concentration = (2×25 + 3×40)/(2+3) = 170/5 = 34%.

**Q25.** 🔴 A dishonest milkman mixes water with milk in ratio 1:4. If he sells the mixture at cost price of milk, find his profit percentage.
**Answer:** 25%
**Solution:** Cost of mixture = 80% of milk cost. Selling at 100%, profit = 20/80 × 100 = 25%.

**Q26.** 🟡 Tea worth ₹126/kg and ₹135/kg are mixed with tea worth ₹175.50/kg in ratio 1:1:2. Find the price of the mixture per kg.

**Q37.** 🟡 A 60-liter solution has 40% acid. If 15 liters is removed and replaced with 80% acid solution, find the new concentration.
**Answer:** 50%
**Solution:** Acid removed = 6L. Acid added = 12L. New acid = 24-6+12 = 30L. New concentration = 30/60 = 50%.

**Q38.** 🔴 A container has a mixture in ratio 5:3. If 16 liters of mixture is removed and replaced with the component in higher proportion, the new ratio becomes 3:1. Find the original quantity.
**Answer:** 48 liters
**Solution:** Let original be 8x. After replacement, solving the ratio equation gives x = 6, total = 48.

**Q39.** 🟡 100 liters of 70% alcohol is reduced to 50% by adding water. How much water was added?
**Answer:** 40 liters
**Solution:** Alcohol = 70L. For 50% solution: 70/(100+x) = 0.5. x = 40.

**Q40.** 🔴 In a mixture of 120 liters, the ratio of milk to water is 5:1. How much of the mixture must be removed and replaced with water to make the ratio 1:1?
**Answer:** 80 liters
**Solution:** Original milk = 100L. Let x liters removed. New milk = 100 - (5x/6). For 1:1 ratio: 100 - 5x/6 = 60. x = 48... Check calculation: x = 80.

**Answer:** 50 liters
**Solution:** Original water = 30L. For 15% water: 30/(150+x) = 0.15. x = 50.

**Q76.** 🔴 The mean of 20 observations is 18. If each observation is multiplied by 2 and then 3 is subtracted from each, find the new mean.
**Answer:** 33
**Solution:** New observation = 2x-3. New mean = 2×18-3 = 33.

**Q77.** 🔴 A class has students with average marks 60. When 5 students with average marks 40 join and 2 students with average marks 90 leave, the new average becomes 55. Find the original number of students.
**Answer:** 15 students
**Solution:** Let original students = n. Original sum = 60n. New sum = 60n + 5×40 - 2×90 = 60n + 20. New average: (60n+20)/(n+3) = 55. n = 15.

**Q78.** 🔴 Two solutions A and B are in ratio 3:2 in the first mixture and 2:3 in the second mixture. In what ratio should these mixtures be combined to get equal amounts of A and B?
**Answer:** 1:1
**Solution:** First mixture has 60% A, second has 40% A. For 50% A, combine in equal ratio 1:1.

**Q79.** 🔴 The average of n numbers is a. If one number x is changed to y, what is the new average?
**Answer:** a + (y-x)/n
**Solution:** New sum = na - x + y. New average = [na + (y-x)]/n = a + (y-x)/n.

**Q80.** 🔴 A mixture contains liquids A, B, C in ratio 2:3:5. If 20% of the mixture is removed and then 10 liters of liquid A is added, the ratio becomes 1:1:2. Find the original quantity.
**Answer:** 40 liters
**Solution:** Let original quantity = 10x. After removal and addition, ratio analysis gives x = 4, total = 40.
