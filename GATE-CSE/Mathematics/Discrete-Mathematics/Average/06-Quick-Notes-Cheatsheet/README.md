# Average - Quick Notes Cheatsheet 📋

## ⚡ Key Formulas & Shortcuts

### Lightning Average Calculator (LAC) Formulas
```
Basic Average: (Sum of all items) / (Number of items)
Weighted Average: (Σ(wi × xi)) / (Σwi)
New Average after addition: ((n×A) + x) / (n+1)
New Average after removal: ((n×A) - x) / (n-1)
```

### Universal Weighted Formula (UWF)
```
Combined Average: (n1×A1 + n2×A2) / (n1+n2)
Three groups: (n1×A1 + n2×A2 + n3×A3) / (n1+n2+n3)
General: Σ(ni×Ai) / Σni
```

### Instant Alligation Predictor (IAP)
```
Mean concentration: c = (m×c1 + n×c2) / (m+n)
Mixing ratio: m/n = (c2-c) / (c-c1)
Quick rule: Cross difference gives ratio
```

### Adaptive Replacement Theory (ART)
```
After one replacement: New% = Old% × (1 - P/100)
After n replacements: Final% = Initial% × (1 - P/100)^n
Where P = percentage replaced each time
```

## 📊 Speed Calculation Tricks

### Lightning Basic Average
```
Numbers: 23, 27, 25, 29, 26
Assumed mean: 25
Deviations: -2, +2, 0, +4, +1
Sum of deviations: +5
Average = 25 + 5/5 = 26
```

### Instant Weighted Average
```
Group 1: 20 students, average 80
Group 2: 30 students, average 90
Combined = (20×80 + 30×90)/(20+30) = 4300/50 = 86
```

### Rapid Alligation Solution
```
Mixture of 60% and 80% alcohol to get 70%:
Ratio = (80-70):(70-60) = 10:10 = 1:1
Equal quantities needed
```

### Quick Replacement Calculation
```
1000L solution, 10% replaced with water each time
After 3 replacements: 
Final % = 100 × (1-0.1)³ = 100 × (0.9)³ = 72.9%
```

## 🔥 Advanced Shortcuts

### LAC Deviation Method
```
For consecutive numbers: Use middle value as assumed mean
For arithmetic progression: Use any term as assumed mean
For random numbers: Use approximate middle value
```

### UWF Weight Optimization
```
If weights are simple ratios: Use ratio method
If weights are large numbers: Use proportional reduction
If weights have common factors: Simplify first
```

### IAP Cross-Pattern
```
c1    c2
  \  /
   c (mean)
  /  \
c2-c  c-c1
Ratio = (c2-c):(c-c1)
```

### ART Replacement Patterns
```
Single ingredient being replaced: Use (1-P/100)^n
Multiple ingredients: Apply to each separately
Continuous replacement: Use differential equation approach
```

## 📊 Common Mistake Prevention

❌ **Avoid**: Adding averages directly
✅ **Do**: Add (average × count) then divide by total count

❌ **Avoid**: Ignoring weights in weighted average
✅ **Do**: Always multiply each value by its weight

❌ **Avoid**: Calculating mixture composition step by step
✅ **Do**: Use direct alligation formula

❌ **Avoid**: Calculating each replacement separately
✅ **Do**: Use exponential formula for multiple replacements
