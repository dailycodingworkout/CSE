## 🔢 QUANTITATIVE APTITUDE - Practice Questions with Solutions

### Simplification - Master These 20 Patterns

#### **Pattern 1: BODMAS with Fractions**
```
Q: 3/4 of 240 + 5/6 of 180 - 2/3 of 150 = ?

Solution:
3/4 × 240 = 180
5/6 × 180 = 150  
2/3 × 150 = 100
Answer: 180 + 150 - 100 = 230
```

#### **Pattern 2: Square Root Simplification**
```
Q: √1764 + √2025 - √1369 = ?

Quick Method:
√1764 = 42 (last digit 4, so root ends in 2 or 8; 42² = 1764)
√2025 = 45 (last digit 5, so root ends in 5; 45² = 2025)
√1369 = 37 (last digit 9, so root ends in 3 or 7; 37² = 1369)
Answer: 42 + 45 - 37 = 50
```

#### **Pattern 3: Percentage of Percentage**
```
Q: 25% of 40% of 300 = ?

Quick Method:
25% of 40% = (25 × 40)/100 = 10%
10% of 300 = 30
Answer: 30
```

### Simple Interest - 15 High-Probability Questions

#### **Type 1: Basic SI Calculation**
```
Q: What will be the simple interest on ₹8000 at 15% per annum for 3 years?

Formula: SI = (P × R × T)/100
SI = (8000 × 15 × 3)/100 = ₹3600
```

#### **Type 2: Finding Principal**
```
Q: At what principal will the simple interest be ₹3000 in 4 years at 12% per annum?

Formula: P = (SI × 100)/(R × T)
P = (3000 × 100)/(12 × 4) = ₹6250
```

#### **Type 3: Double in Time**
```
Q: In how many years will ₹5000 become ₹8000 at 10% simple interest?

SI needed = 8000 - 5000 = ₹3000
Time = (SI × 100)/(P × R) = (3000 × 100)/(5000 × 10) = 6 years
```

### Compound Interest - Master These Shortcuts

#### **CI for 2 Years Shortcut**
```
Formula: CI = P[(R/100)² + 2(R/100)]

Q: CI on ₹10000 for 2 years at 20% p.a.
CI = 10000[(20/100)² + 2(20/100)]
CI = 10000[0.04 + 0.40] = 10000 × 0.44 = ₹4400
```

#### **Difference between CI and SI**
```
For 2 years: CI - SI = P(R/100)²
For 3 years: CI - SI = P(R/100)²(300 + R)/100

Q: Difference between CI and SI on ₹8000 for 2 years at 15%
Difference = 8000(15/100)² = 8000 × 0.0225 = ₹180
```

### Time and Work - 12 Essential Question Types

#### **Type 1: Basic Work Rate**
```
Q: A can complete work in 12 days, B in 15 days. In how many days together?

Formula: Combined time = (A × B)/(A + B)
Time = (12 × 15)/(12 + 15) = 180/27 = 6⅔ days
```

#### **Type 2: Work and Wages**
```
Q: A, B, C can complete work in 10, 12, 15 days. If they get ₹2700, find A's share.

Work rates: A = 1/10, B = 1/12, C = 1/15 per day
Ratio of work = 6:5:4 (LCM method)
A's share = (6/15) × 2700 = ₹1080
```

#### **Type 3: Alternative Work**
```
Q: A and B working alternatively, starting with A, finish work in 25 days. 
A alone takes 20 days, B alone takes 30 days. Find actual time.

In 24 days (12 complete cycles): Work done = 12(1/20 + 1/30) = 12 × 1/12 = 1
So work finishes in exactly 24 days, not 25.
```

### Time, Speed & Distance - 10 Must-Know Types

#### **Type 1: Relative Speed**
```
Q: Two trains 100m and 150m long, running at 60 km/h and 40 km/h in opposite directions. 
Time to cross each other?

Relative speed = 60 + 40 = 100 km/h = 100 × 5/18 = 25/9 m/s
Combined length = 100 + 150 = 250m
Time = 250 ÷ (25/9) = 250 × 9/25 = 90 seconds
```

#### **Type 2: Boats and Streams**
```
Q: Speed of boat in still water = 15 km/h, stream = 3 km/h. 
Time to go 36 km downstream and return?

Downstream speed = 15 + 3 = 18 km/h
Upstream speed = 15 - 3 = 12 km/h
Time downstream = 36/18 = 2 hours
Time upstream = 36/12 = 3 hours
Total time = 5 hours
```

### Data Interpretation - High-Scoring Practice

#### **Table DI - 5 Questions Set**
```
Company    2019    2020    2021    2022    2023
A          120     140     160     180     200
B          100     120     150     170     190
C          80      95      110     125     140

Q1: What is the average production of Company A over 5 years?
Average = (120+140+160+180+200)/5 = 800/5 = 160

Q2: In which year was the total production maximum?
2019: 300, 2020: 355, 2021: 420, 2022: 475, 2023: 530
Maximum in 2023 = 530

Q3: What is the percentage increase in Company B from 2019 to 2023?
Increase% = (190-100)/100 × 100 = 90%
```

### Error Detection - 20 High-Frequency Patterns

#### **Pattern 1: Subject-Verb Agreement**
```
Q: Each of the students (a)/ have been asked (b)/ to submit their assignments (c)/ by tomorrow. (d)

Error: (b) "have been" should be "has been"
Reason: "Each of" takes singular verb
```

#### **Pattern 2: Preposition Error**
```
Q: She is very good (a)/ in mathematics and (b)/ has always scored (c)/ high marks. (d)

Error: (b) "good in" should be "good at"  
Reason: "Good at" is correct for subjects/skills
```

#### **Pattern 3: Tense Consistency**
```
Q: He went to the market (a)/ yesterday and (b)/ buys some vegetables (c)/ for dinner. (d)

Error: (c) "buys" should be "bought"
Reason: Past action requires past tense
```

```

#### **Type 2: Grammar-based**
```
Q: Neither of the two candidates _____ suitable for the position.
a) are    b) were    c) is    d) have been  

Answer: (c) is - "Neither" takes singular verb
```

## 🧠 REASONING ABILITY - Practice Questions

### Syllogism - 10 Must-Practice Sets

#### **Set 1:**
```
Statements: All flowers are beautiful. Some beautiful things are expensive.
Conclusions: 
I. All flowers are expensive
II. Some flowers are expensive

Solution:
I. FALSE - No direct connection between flowers and expensive
II. POSSIBLE - Some overlap area might contain flowers
Answer: Only II follows
```

#### **Set 2:**
```
Statements: No cat is a dog. All dogs are animals.
Conclusions:
I. No cat is an animal  
II. Some animals are not cats

Solution:
I. FALSE - Cats can be animals through different path
II. TRUE - Dogs are animals but not cats
Answer: Only II follows
```

### Coded Inequalities - 8 Standard Patterns

#### **Pattern 1:**
```
Statements: P > Q ≥ R = S < T
Conclusions: 
I. P > S    II. T > Q

Solution:
I. TRUE - P > Q ≥ R = S, so P > S
II. TRUE - Q ≥ R = S < T, so T > S = R ≤ Q, but since S < T and S = R ≤ Q, 
   we need to check: T > S = R ≤ Q, so T > Q is FALSE
Answer: Only I follows
```

### Seating Arrangement - Step-by-Step Solution

#### **Linear Arrangement Problem:**
```
7 people A, B, C, D, E, F, G sit in a row facing North.
- A sits 3rd from left end
- B sits 2nd to the right of A  
- C sits at one of the extreme ends
- D sits immediately to the left of C
- E doesn't sit at any end
- F sits 2nd to the left of G

Solution Steps:
Step 1: A at position 3
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
          _ _ A _ _ _ _

Step 2: B sits 2nd right of A (position 5)
          _ _ A _ B _ _

Step 3: C at extreme end, D immediately left of C
If C at position 1, then D would be at position 0 (impossible)
So C at position 7, D at position 6
          _ _ A _ B D C

Step 4: E doesn't sit at ends, so E at position 2 or 4
Step 5: F sits 2nd left of G
If G at position 1, F would be at position -1 (impossible)
If E at position 2, then remaining are F and G at positions 1 and 4
F 2nd left of G means G at position 4, F at position 2 (impossible, E there)
So E at position 4, F at position 1, G at position 2

Final: F G A E B D C
       1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

### Direction Sense - 5 Complete Problems

#### **Problem 1:**
```
Q: Rohan starts from his house and walks 5 km North, then turns right and walks 3 km, 
then turns right again and walks 7 km, then turns left and walks 2 km. 
How far is he from his starting point?

Solution:
Starting point: (0,0)
After 5km North: (0,5)
After right turn + 3km East: (3,5)  
After right turn + 7km South: (3,-2)
After left turn + 2km East: (5,-2)

Distance = √[(5-0)² + (-2-0)²] = √[25 + 4] = √29 ≈ 5.4 km
```
